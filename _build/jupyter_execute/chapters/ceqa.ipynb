    "# CEQA/NEPA\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) compliance and documentation are requred for all planned projects. Projects on federal lands require NEPA, everything else requires CEQA. However, most California state funded projects may require CEQA regardless of project location.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CEQA\n",
    "This flowchart is a general CEQA process for any project requiring CEQA compliance. With forest health and wood products projects, please use the diagram as an overall environmental frame of reference rather than the exact process to obtain compliance for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general flowchart showing the decision making process for Calfornia Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for any project on nonfederal land in California ({numref}`ceqa`).\n",

    "General CEQA flowchart (adapted from {cite}`ceqa`). \n",
    "```\n",
    "The types of CEQA documents are many, but generally encompass the following broad categories listed from low risk/short completion time to high risk/long completion time:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Notice of Exemption (NOE)** = The project is Categorically Exempt with no exceptions or has no possibility of having an impact on the environment.\n",
    "2. **Initial Study** = Identifies project env impacts.\n",
    "3. **Negative Declarations (neg dec/MND)** = The project will not have significant environmental impacts (neg dec) or has been redesigned to eliminate any significant impacts (Mitigated Negative Declaration, MND).\n",
    "4. **Environmental Impact Report (EIR)** = Prepared when significant environmental impacts are identified. \n",
    "\n",
    "## CalVTP\n",
    "The California Vegetation Treatment Program ([CalVTP(http://gg.gg/1anhib)]) includes the use of prescribed burning, mechanical treatments, manual treatments (including reforestation), herbicide application, and prescribed herbivory as tools to reduce hazardous vegetation around communities in the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), to construct fuel breaks (shaded or non-shaded), and to promote ecological restoration. A general VTP process flowchart is shown in {numref}`vtp`.\n",

    "Timber/Commercial Definitions\n",
    "California Code PRC 4527\n",
    "\n",
    "(a)(1) \"Timber operations\" means the cutting or removal, or both, of timber or other solid wood forest products, including Christmas trees, from timberlands for commercial purposes, together with all the incidental work...\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) \"Commercial purpose\" includes (A) the cutting or removal of trees that are processed into logs, lumber, or other wood products and offered for sale, barter, exchange or trade...\n",
    "\n",
    "Timber Harvest Plans (THPs)\n",
    "Section IV - Cumulative Impacts Assessmentt of a THP makes the plan compliant with CEQA. Once the THP is approved it is the functional equivalent of an EIR. The same applies to NTMPs.\n",

    "Example projects and CEQA/NEPA compliance.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notes on the examples: \n",
    "1. Often added to an existing project where CEQA has been completed. In these cases, project proponents can use existing CEQA analysis and make the determination there are no new significant impacts via an addendum to the existing document.\n",
    "2. Prior to the training, those lands would need to have completed CEQA and provide a copy of the analyses to CAL FIRE.\n",
    "3. Projects submitting NEPA documents that created the biomass would be statutorily exempt from CEQA (AB211 - PRC 4799.05(d)(1)).\n",
    "4. Projects could utilize the CEQA documents that created the biomass. In some cases, the transport is included in the facility analysis so the facility impacts CEQA documents can be used if they included the biomass transport to the facility. See CEQA Statutory Exemption 21080(b)(3) and CEQA Guidelines Section 15269(a) for reforestation and emergency exemptions.\n",
