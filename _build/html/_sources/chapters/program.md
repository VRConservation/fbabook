# Program Design

Chris Sacco & Vance Russell | Forest Business Alliance

## Takeaways

- **Programmatic = proactive**. A programmatic or portfolio design approach creates a proactive strategy for your business or nonprofit, allowing prioritization of the projects and funding you pursue. Instead of the "tail wagging the dog" where you respond to funding requests and potentially change your organization, you create a framework to build programmatic and financial sustainability to reach your objectives, goals, and mission.
- **Acknowledge assumptions**. All project implementation interventions have inherent assumptions. Acknowledge these in your theory of change and periodically test whether they are correct, e.g., does the intervention lead to the intended outcomes?
- **Iterate and scale**. Iterate and learn. Start small, experiment, and scale your successes {cite}`ears`. Scaling quote from Salafsky and Margoluis {cite}`scaling`.

## Background

Originally published in 2023, the full version of this article is available at the [Forest Business Alliance](https://www.forestbusinessalliance.org) templates page.[^1]

The Forest Business Alliance (FBA) created this guide to help grant seekers, program managers, and business owners design projects for submission to CAL FIRE's Wood Products and Bioenergy Business and Workforce Development Grant [Program](http://gg.gg/1agl2y). These templates and guidance may also be useful for USDA Forest Service Wood Innovation and Community Wood Grant [Programs](http://gg.gg/1agk52) and other state/federal grants.

During the design process, your project team will decide which problems and causes to address, what strengths and opportunities to leverage, where you will work, with whom, and at what scale. Your project team will also specify what it will and will not do by establishing achievable and measurable goals and objectives, selecting sound strategies, developing detailed activity plans, and setting targets.

The contents of this guidance document and the accompanying worksheets are presented chronologically:

1. Situation assessment
2. Theory of Change
3. Goals & Objectives
4. Monitoring (see monitoring chapter for more detail)
5. Budget
6. Implementation

The guidance and workbook's step-by-step organization helps you move deliberately through the design process. However, keep in mind that project design is iterative and dynamic. As you add detail when progressing from one step to the next, you may find it necessary to go back and revise the information you input during prior steps.

We used numerous publicly available sources to create the project design and monitoring templates and adapted information to create resources suited to the CAL FIRE funding opportunity. The [Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation](http://gg.gg/1agk6k), developed by the Conservation Measures Partnership {cite}`cmp`, and [ProPack I: Project Design Guidance for Project and Program Managers](http://gg.gg/1agk6l), developed by Catholic Relief Services {cite}`propack`, are among the key sources we relied upon to develop this chapter.

## Assessment

Program and project planning typically begins with a participatory assessment of your business and organization and with the board, stakeholders, and clients. During this situation assessment phase, you will specify the basic parameters for your project and improve your understanding of the project’s context. Pages 13 through 24 of the [Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation](http://gg.gg/1agli2) provide an excellent primer on assessment. Conducting a thorough situation or problem analysis is central to your assessment work. Your design team should review available evidence to complete your analysis, identifying the direct threats, core problems, and indirect threats, also known as drivers and causes.

```{figure} /figures/situ.png
:name: situation

```

A situation model is a tool that visually portrays the relationships among the various factors in your situation analysis ({numref}`situation`). The model should illustrate the main cause-and-effect relationships and include the most important details, yet be as simple as possible. To the degree that it is feasible and useful, you should identify the actors behind key factors and discuss assumptions between the relationship factors.

Although Figure 2.1 depicts a conservation-focused model, a business can easily adapt it to suit its business model. The drivers and threats to healthy forests will remain the same in a forested system, but the strategy, scope, and targets may change. For instance, a wood products business may be focused on utilizing the wood produced by thinning projects and possibly increasing workforce capacity. Adapting the situation model to a forest business may look like {numref}`situ-biz`.

```{figure} /figures/situ-biz.png
:name: situ-biz

```

Project design teams frequently use assessment findings to construct problem trees ({numref}`tree`). These causal diagrams help you identify and study core problems by identifying their immediate and underlying causes and their negative effects. This analysis, in turn, allows you to identify solutions that will address the problems rather than their symptoms. A problem tree is also useful for understanding your intervention->outcome links. It provides a vital bridge to the objectives hierarchy in a results framework in the next step of the project design process.

```{figure} /figures/tree.jpeg
:name: tree

```

During problem analysis, the process is as important as the end product. The exercise should be treated as a learning experience. Problem tree analysis is typically done with your design team and possibly other stakeholders at a participatory workshop or video call using Miro or other whiteboards. Participants write problems, immediate causes, root causes, and effects on sticky notes or note cards. Each card should contain only one item. This allows participants to move the cards around and discuss where they best fit within the problem tree. Experience in facilitating the problem tree method and familiarity with the local context are important considerations when selecting a facilitator. Once you have constructed a problem tree with a logical flow, record it on the Problem Analysis worksheet.

Once you have created your situation model or problem trees, review the logic by asking these questions:

- Does each cause-effect link make sense? Is each link plausible? Why or why not?
- How well have the causes connected to the roots? Are there any unidentified root causes?
- What appears to be the relative contribution of each causal stream to the problem/threat? Do some causes appear more than once? Why is this?

In addition to helping you design a project that responds to causes instead of their symptoms, the assessment and problem analysis you have done will provide findings and conclusions that help you to write a compelling and context‑specific problem analysis for the proposal narrative.

## Theory of Change

A Theory of Change bridges the problem analysis visualized in the problem tree(s) and the proposed responses reflected in the project’s results framework or ProFrame {numref}`toc2`. The theory of change clarifies why you believe the selected project strategies will work in the project context and justifies and checks the logic and feasibility of the change hypothesis. A theory of change can be expressed in narrative or diagrammatic form.

```{note}
A narrative Theory of Change is a concise, explicit explanation of:

“IF we implement strategies 1, 2, and 3 and our assumptions hold true
THEN, we will achieve the following interim results and outcomes
BECAUSE of a defensible/cited evidence base"
```

With this structure, the theory of change clarifies how (if–then) and why (because) the project team expects or assumes that certain actions will produce desired changes for individuals, groups, communities, or institutions in the environment where the project will be implemented ({numref}`toc2`).

```{figure} /figures/toc2.png
:name: toc2
Simplified theory of change.
```

The theory of change is not simply a narrative description of the results framework because the results framework only reflects the elements (the “ifs” and “then” parts) that the project will deliver, whereas the theory of change also states those actions or contributions critical to the project success but which you expect other actors to deliver. In other words, the theory of change reflects both the results framework and the project’s hypotheses and assumptions. Remember that the theory of change can be developed for different levels of the objectives hierarchy. A “high‑level” theory of change articulates how successful achievement of the project’s objectives will contribute to longer‑term, broader, lasting change (project’s goal). You should minimally create a theory of change at this level. However, it may be necessary to create links from all project strategies to outcomes.

### Results Chains

Instead of a narrative theory of change, you may use a results chain, a visual diagram of a theory of change ({numref}`rc2`). The results chain shows the strategies identified in the situation model and connects them to interim results and project outcomes.

```{figure} /figures/rc2.png
:name: rc2
Results chains are a visual diagram of a theory of change showing anticipated outcomes {cite}`cmp`.
```

A more specific example of workforce capacity building is shown in {numref}`rc3`. Once you have finished developing all project results chains, you can write your goals and objectives.

```{figure} /figures/rc3.png
:name: rc3

```

## Goals & Objectives

Goals and objectives are often reversed, conflated, or used interchangeably. That defeats the purpose of having two words for two important planning terms. Well-written goals and objective statements follow specific formulas at different levels of the project’s hierarchy. Below, we provide guidance on creating statements for each level. Review CAL FIRE’s required metrics before you develop your goals and objective statements. Reviewing and understanding them is necessary for creating goals and objectives that align with CAL FIRE’s goals.

**Goals** are the high-level, long-term results and impacts a project seeks to achieve. Derived from the scope of your situation assessment, they represent the desired status of the specific targets identified. Like objectives, goals are specific, measurable, and time-bound but typically over a much longer period of time, e.g., decades rather than months or years. Unlike objectives, the project’s goal statement is usually general and abstract, describing a desired state beyond the project's life. For this reason, often, a goal will not have an associated indicator associated with it.

```{admonition} Example
By 2035 the Central Coast Region of California will increase forest thinning and prescribed fire capacity by 10%.
```

**Objectives** represent the higher-order changes in systems, communities, or organizations that can reasonably be achieved during a project's time frame and provide the building blocks to achieve goals. Well-written objectives are SMART = specific, measurable, achievable, results-oriented, and time-bound and are tied to the intermediate results and outcomes in a theory of change or results chains. In many projects, objectives reflect the benefits expected to occur for communities by the end of the project as a result of behavioral changes at the interim results level.

```{admonition} Example
By September 2025, 300 future thinning and prescribed fire crew members from the Central Coast Region will be trained and red-carded.
```

**Interim results** state the expected changes in identifiable behaviors by participants or in identifiable approaches by interventions, systems, policies, or institutions as a result of what was gained (outputs) through project actions (activities). Progress at this level is a necessary precondition for achieving the objectives. Write intermediate results as complete sentences, as if already achieved. Put the targeted primary beneficiary group(s) whose behavior is expected to change as the sentence's subject. Interim results may focus on demonstrable evidence of behavior change, such as adoption, uptake, or coverage.

```{admonition} Example
Training organizations will coordinate to identify 1,000 potential crew members from disadvantaged communities of the Central Coast to participate in comprehensive thinning and prescribed fire practical courses by 2023.
```

**Outputs** are the tangible products, goods, and services from implementing specific activities. More than one output may be needed to achieve a single intermediate result or objective. To create outputs, ask what the project needs to produce or provide to achieve short to medium-term results. Write outputs as complete sentences, as if already achieved. Put the targeted primary beneficiary group(s) receiving the outputs as the sentence's subject.

```{admonition} Example
Forest sector businesses increased their knowledge of improved technologies and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

**Activities** describe the functions to be undertaken and managed to deliver the project’s outputs to the targeted beneficiaries and participants. Normally, more than one activity is needed to achieve an individual output. Activities are not included at the project design stage to avoid overcomplicating the project results framework. You will include the full breadth of specific activities when you develop the Project Framework (ProFrame) and Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP).

```{admonition} Example
Organization X provides training for owners and staff of forest sector businesses on improved technology and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

The goal, objective, and intermediate results statements will begin to flesh out a programmatic level of planning that projects can tier from. Review the list of questions below and use the “if-then” test to confirm the logic between each level of the results framework. Every statement should clearly lead to the next higher-level statement. Revise your goal, objective, and intermediate result statements if the logic is unclear. Review your results chains and situation assessments to evaluate whether or not collective your goals and objectives will address the problems and measure long-term outcomes inherent in the results chains:

- Do the objectives describe the central purpose of the project?
- Are the objectives specific to the project context?
- Can the objectives be realistically achieved by the end of the project?
- Do the objectives logically contribute towards the achievement of the goal?
- Does the number of objectives make sense given the project time frame, scope, scale, and budget?
- Do the intermediate results reflect the project strategy and theory of change?
- Do the intermediate results reflect the right change agents and behaviors?
- Is the complement of intermediate results necessary and sufficient to deliver change at the objective level?

You should revisit this list of questions as you progress through the design process.

## Monitoring

This is a logical point to start developing a monitoring plan. Please see the Measuring Success chapter for more details on developing this. Very briefly, however, a monitoring plan measures your progress on project goals and objectives by developing indicators or metrics linked to objectives. The plan creates a framework for the methodology, frequency, timing, and responsibility of measuring outcomes ({numref}`mel`). As shown in the figure, some plans include an at-a-glance graphic for trends in the metric status to assist managers in prioritizing their time to project success.

```{figure} /figures/mel.png
:name: mel

```

The monitoring plan should also indicate clear steps toward data analysis, learning, and adaptation. The Measuring Success chapter covers these steps in more detail.

```{caution}
Create a realistic monitoring plan for your budget, program, or business. Most leave monitoring for last, neglect it or fail to analyze and learn from the results. See the monitoring chapter for a practitioner's approach to developing and implementing a monitoring and learning plan.
```

## Budget

We've left the budget for last as it depends on the overall framework of situation assessment, results chains, and goals/objectives. However, we recommend developing a back-of-the-envelope budget early in the proposal writing. Just like the entire design process, budget development is iterative. You will need to adjust budget line items and amounts as other project elements take shape or change.

Identifying and reviewing a proposal's requirements and other set project parameters early will help focus project design efforts and keep expectations in line with reality. One key parameter is the amount of money available for direct program implementation. Starting with a rough estimate of the required fieldwork will help you make realistic project scope and scale decisions.

Let's look at an example. A one million dollar project still seems like a large amount of funding for many organizations. Let's put this into a simple budget calculator ({numref}`budget`). In this simplified example, salaries (35%) include benefits and contracted labor. Implementation (50%) is for all non-salary project costs, such as supplies, equipment, and travel. Indirect (15%) is for an organization's operating costs, e.g., rent, utilities, and fees. This immediately informs the project team that roughly half of the request will be implemented.

```{list-table} Back-of-the-envelope budget calculator.
:header-rows: 1
:name: budget

* - Item
  - Amount
* - Salaries
  - 350,000
* - Implementation
  - 500,000
* - Indirect
  - 150,000
* - **Total**
  - **1,000,000**
```

```{warning} **Critical**: include inflationary increases in your budget, including salaries and costs for supplies and equipment (at least 4%/yr). If an application only allows one number per item, calculate costs in your budget spreadsheet over the number of years of the project.

```

### Budget process

An internal budget development process is critical for developing defensible numbers to fund the project over time.

1. Create draft goals and metrics for the project
2. Draft a back-of-the-envelope budget by project category or deliverable, roughing out the approximate costs with rules that divide out salaries implementation
3. Write a proposal narrative
4. Create a project GANTT chart with deliverables from the budget and narrative
5. Return to the budget and update numbers

```{tip} When you create a GANTT chart in Excel, make the deliverable names equal in the chart to your budget deliverable headings in the budget spreadsheet. When you change the budget deliverables, the GANTT deliverables will also change.

```

## Implementation

As you developed your results framework and theory of change and selected viable project strategies, you clarified how intermediate results led to objectives, contributing to the goal. You highlighted underlying assumptions and established the evidence base for the project strategies. During prior steps in the design process, you also likely defined broad illustrative activities and possibly outputs.

Discuss how activities lead to outputs (and, in turn, their related intermediate results). Focus on major, illustrative activities or categories of activities. Do not get distracted by details, but rather, focus on making the “how” clear. As you discuss and refine activities and outputs – and how they lead to achieving related intermediate results – think ahead and consider what is feasible given the project budget, timeline, etc. Developing project activities is an iterative process. As you provide more details in the ProFrame (and eventually the budget), you will have a better idea of costs, allowing you to adjust project targets accordingly.

If you identify any potential assumptions, your team should determine whether you:

- Adjust the design to minimize the risk;
- Redesign the program or project because the risk is too high; or
- Maintain the design as is, recognizing that the risk is unlikely to affect the project.

## Resources

- The [Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation](http://gg.gg/1agk6k), developed by the Conservation Measures Partnership {cite}`cmp` is a definitive resource for program and project design.
- [ProPack I: Project Design Guidance for Project and Program Managers](http://gg.gg/1agk6l), developed by Catholic Relief Services {cite}`propack` is a useful resource.
- Business planning can be different from organizational planning and typically focuses on developing a strategic business plan and pitch deck. See the [Forest Business Alliance](https://www.forestbusinessalliance.org/) templates page for a business plan template.
- [Miradi](https://www.miradishare.org/ux/home) is designed to help project proponents move through and plan the various stages of a program and projects and is widely adaptable.
- [ArcGIS StoryMaps](http://gg.gg/1ahzng) useful to complement their assessment, theory of change, and planning efforts. FBA prepared a storymap about [Spatial Business Planning](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/647313bcdb3e4d6c82e4733eee7ab693) as an example of how this powerful tool can be used with geospatial analyses for program or business planning efforts.
- Geospatial analysis tools such as QGIS, Geemap, Leafmap, Google Earth Engine, R, and geospatial Python libraries are critical for planning forest conservation and businesses using spatial data and analysis. Looking for ways to integrate program design to guide geospatial analysis and the analysis to ratify or measure components created in the program design is a beneficial way to incorporate spatial data into planning.
