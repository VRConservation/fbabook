# Measurement
Measuring project success and learning from implementation is critical to long-term organizational and business viability. If you do it right it will make your smarter, learn faster, ad increase investment. Ignore it at your peril!

## Takeaways
- **Do it**. Figure out a cost feasible way to build monitoring into your project budgeting, design, and implementation. Use remot sensing or citizen science volunteers to reduce costs and determine other ways to measure your outcomes. Donors and investors will pay attention to your results and iterative learning.
- **TOC->Monitoring**. Link your assessment or theory of change to your monitoring and learning
- **Take time to learn**. Build learning into our organizational culture. Plan a retreat to analyze results and write about project learning that you publish in blogs, posts, and journals.

## Background
Like the Korean and Vietnam Wars in your high school history class, monitoring and evaluation is often forgotten, neglected, or not linked to learning and new project design. Reporting is often treated as a required task like toiling in the salt mines for your sustenance. But neither should be that way and many organizations are missing a trick of learning from both of these activities. 

Unfortunately not many funders cover extensive monitoring costs 

FBA has included worksheets to help you track progress and prepare reports if CAL FIRE funds your project. You do not need to complete these worksheets during the design phase.
