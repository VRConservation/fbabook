# Measuring Success
Measuring project success and learning from implementation is critical to long-term organizational and business viability.

**Note: what if focus is how to do success monitoring on a shoestring?**

## Takeaways
- **Effective success measurement is challenging**. Funding, implementing, and getting staff, stakeholders, and key audiences about 'M&E' is difficult at best, impossible at worst. It's also easy to get wrong, get left behind doing it at project's end (since everyone is chasing the next funding or project implementation), and mindfully reflect on lessons learned. Look for ways to make it cost feasible and maximize outcomes measurement.  Use remote sensing or citizen science volunteers to reduce costs and determine other ways to measure your outcomes. Donors and investors will pay attention to your results and iterative learning.
- **Theory -> Monitoring -> Learning**. Link your assessment or theory of change to your monitoring and learning
- **Take time to learn**. Build learning into our organizational culture. Plan a retreat to analyze results and write about project learning that you publish in blogs, posts, and journals.
- **Do the big picture 1st**. There is a tendency to jump straight to metrics and indicators before developing a theory of change and programmatic goals and objectives. Monitoring plans should tier from the big picture, so go through the process to develop the program strategy first. However, once developed, don't be afraid to change items, such as false assumption or critical pathways that don't reflect reality.

## Background
Like the Korean and Vietnam Wars in your high school history class, monitoring and evaluation is often forgotten, neglected, or not linked to learning and new or revised project design. Reporting is often treated as a required task like toiling in the salt mines for your sustenance. But neither should be that way and many organizations are missing a trick of learning from both of these activities to maximize their impact, attracting new investors/donors, and marching towards success. 

Unfortunately not many donors cover monitoring costs or monitoring is completed but project managers and teams do not have time to analyze the data and create a learning environment around the results. There are many resources available to plan projects and develop monitoring plans. This guide is not an exhaustive resource and is focused on developing your monitoring and measuring success when evalation resources and capacity is limited.

## Caveats
- **Consult experts (but not too much)**. Consult experts and have them review your monitoring plan, methodologies, analyses, and results. However, do not look to academices or graduate students to run or fully develop your monitoring and learning. On the other hand, it is extremely worthwhile to develop a research agenda with academics and students to guide research to your work and create learning that is deeper than monitoring results. Here's why: applied research and monitoring are unlike in many ways. Research can guide your methods and direct your learning but it is about finding levels of significance (>90% confidence) that are typically not feasible for programmatic implementation (~ > 75% but depends on the project and the confidence may be qualitative). Researchers want to publish, and so should NGO's but not as often in peer reviewed journals. You should experiement at small scales then scale when experimentation works. 
- **Create and revisit your monitoring plan**.
