# Scaling
A short guide to scaling forest businesses and organizations from local to landscape

## Takeaways

## Background
Surprisingly little is written on scaling nonprofits. Overwhelmingly, a lot is written on scaling businesses. Few to none of this _oevre_ is connected to forest health, with the majority of articles focused on scaling tech startups.

## Challenges
- Gov efforts focused mostly on nonprofits, RCDs and agencies. Deploying capital to businesses and startups is slow and doesn't always focus on what's needed most, e.g., operating capital, or support during the most challenging phases of startup or scaling when needed the most.
- Agreements, contracting and compliance may also slow scaling.
- Public capital is not being leveraged with private.
- Coordination across multiple actors in a region is challenging, but do-able. Look at projects in the CNRA tracking and they look puny compared to the actual task at hand of 1 million acres treated
