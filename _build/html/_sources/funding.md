The Business of Wildfire and Forest Health Is Booming: An Analysis of CAL FIRE's Business and Workforce Development Grants

[Forest Business Alliance](https://www.forestbusinessalliance.org/)

## Findings
To better understand the geographic distribution, success rates, and funding gaps/needs, the Forest Business Alliance undertook a preliminary study examining CAL FIRE's Business and Workforce Development Grants from the first quarter of 2022 through the third quarter of 2023 (new data and analysis will be added when available). The initial analysis of CAL FIRE's Business and Workforce Development Grants Program found the following:

- More funding is needed for the Program; funding requests or needs far outstrip the grant funds awarded. As of Q3 2023, about \$70 million in requests were funded, but the total requests were nearly \$263 million. Sustainable infrastructure to process wood biomass in California and workforce development are critical elements of the <a href="http://gg.gg/1a38lc" target="_blank">Roadmap to a Million Acres</a>.
- The top 10 grant-receiving counties in order were Tuolumne, Shasta, Yolo, Placer, Tulare, Siskiyou, Humboldt, Plumas, Fresno, and Mariposa Counties. 
- Every county had projects that requested funds, but Merced, Los Angeles, Inyo, Colusa, DelNorte, Orange, Kern, Riverside, Kings, and Monterey counties did not receive funding in the period examined.
- The largest proportion of grants awarded in November 2023 went to Northern California, with 80% going to the North Coast (19%) and Sierra Cascade (61%) regions. The Central Coast (3%) and Southern California (1%) were far behind. The total requested mirrors these percentages by region, although they are slightly higher for the Central Coast (4%) and Southern California (3%).
- The counties with the highest grant success rate (% successfully funded) were Sutter, Stanislaus, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, Siskiyou, Sacramento, Nevada, Mariposa, and Alpine counties. However, a bivariate analysis simultaneously examining requested and awarded amounts showed that the most successful counties (high amount awarded with low amount requested) were Ventura, Alpine, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Sutter Counties.
- To increase the analysis accuracy, a more precise project location of the applicants is needed. Precise location data for applicants and grantees would also help in the analysis of counties and regions with the most need, e.g., disadvantaged communities.

## Fire
Prior to European settlement, fires were commonly utilized throughout California by Tribal communities as a tool for managing food, game, disease, and community safety. Approximately 4.4 million acres burned annually in California before 1800 {cite}`stephens_etal_2007`. This acreage is far more than recent years, but likely differs in the total acres burned at high severity. Fast forward to the present, fire suppression, severe drought, and climate change have created forest ecosystems well outside their natural conditions, making them prone to severe wildfires and negatively affecting habitats and communities ({numref}`California`).

Some areas have burned multiple times. The bright red area circled in blue southeast of Lake Berryessa, along Highway 128, is the most frequently burned area in California ({numref}`berryessa2`).

In other regions, large wildfires created devastating consequences ({numref}`dixie`). The 2018 Camp Fire (pink) killed 85 people and destroyed the community of Paradise {cite}`camp`. Three years later, the Dixie Fire (red) burned nearly 1 million acres and caused $1.15 billion in damage {cite}`dixie`.

```{figure} /figures/dixie.png

The preponderance of large fires in the early 2000s built a wealth of support for forest health projects to thin unhealthy forest stands and reintroduce fire into forested ecosystems. Those projects created excess wood and biomass that needed to be removed from the forest to avoid additional wildfire risk. To encourage wood utilization, the USDA Forest Service had the Wood Innovations Grant Program. At the state level, CAL FIRE responded by creating the Wood Products and Bioenergy Program with the first grants awarded in 2022. The Forest Business Alliance conducted an initial study on where the funds went to analyze patterns and identify areas of potential future need or funding focus.

## Analysis
The initial funding analysis examined awards by county from the 1st quarter of 2022 to the 3rd quarter of 2023 ({numref}`awarded_ca`).

### Awarded
The darker green counties indicate a higher amount awarded from CAL FIRE's Business and Workforce Development Grant Program. The total amounts (1,000s $USD) are normalized by each county's total square kilometers of forest (total awarded/sq. km forest).

```{figure} /figures/awarded_ca.png
:name: awarded_ca

```

Not surprisingly, the highest grants/square km of forest are in the north state, dominated by the Sierra Nevada and North Coast counties ({numref}`norcal`). Surprisingly, some agriculturally dominant counties rank highly, e.g., Yolo, partly because large bioenergy projects were funded in the county.

As of autumn 2023, only two counties in Southern California had projects with funding: San Luis Obispo and Ventura ({numref}`socal`). However, much of Southern California is chaparral and desert, and fire mitigation in this region is focused more on preventing ignition sources rather than thinning forests or processing wood products.

### Bivariate
A bivariate analysis querying the data by total requests and awards paints a slightly different picture than the awards analysis ({numref}`biv`). Where the success rate is the relationship between funded and requested grants, the lightest shades tend to indicate low success rates, whereas the light blue to dark purple indicate counties with high grant success rates.

```{figure} /figures/biv.png
:name: biv

```
{numref}`biv` reveals some Southern California counties have requested grants but not been successful (e.g., San Luis Obispo, Kern, Orange, Riverside) and Ventura has a high success rate (high awarded to requested). Sacramento, Sutter, and Alpine Counties, shown in light blue, are similar high success rate counties, whereas counties such as Tulare, Plumas, and Shasta have received a large amount of funding and have also made a large number of requests.

### Gaps
The total funding requests and awards by county show the divide between the northern and southern portions of the state({numref}`chart`). The largest number of grants requested and awarded were in the Sierra Cascade Region. Nevertheless, the totals do not explain grant and project quality within the region. For instance, Inyo, Kings, and Merced have not funded any projects. The Forest Business Alliance addresses the lack of capacity in each entity's ability to apply for grants to strengthen sustainable forest businesses and process more wood to ultimately increase forest health across the state.

Funding by project type showed the most funding for workforce development training, biomass, transportation, and equipment projects ({numref}`type`). Business development, marketing, and thinning projects were the least funded project types.

The number of unfunded projects by county reveals interesting patterns ({numref}`nofund`). Some counties with the highest number of unsuccessful applications are in the Sierra Cascade Region, e.g., Tuolumne, Shasta, Plumas. Counties with low success raters submitted fewer proposals, e.g., Inyo, Kings, and Alpine.

## Next
The Forest Business Alliance will continue to add new projects to the Business and Workforce Development funding analysis database as applications are submitted and awards granted. We recommend the following:

- More accurate project locations, e.g., latitude/longitude points should be added to reflect where the funding is directed and look at the relationship between forest health and wood products businesses.
- As more projects are funded through subsequent grant rounds how do the funding success rates change geographically?
- More analysis is needed to determine the reasons for the county and regional differences. Is it organizational and business capacity? Is it more related to capabilities to create strong projects and proposals? Could it be something more pervasive such as regional economic differences or available institutional support for potential applicants?
- Given the need for wildfire mitigation in the state, the bottleneck of processing biomass in a sustainable manner, and the mismatch in requested vs. funded businesses, we highly recommend the state consider increasing funding for this valuable program.

## Data
The proposal data is freely available on CAL FIRE's Wood Products & Bioenergy website. To conduct the analysis, we removed statewide grants since they could not be placed geographically. For projects covering multiple counties, we averaged the total requests and awards across each county identified for the project. The data was compiled in Excel and then joined to a county spatial (California Tiger Census layer) and a vegetation layer (Calveg) to create the spatial database. The spatial analysis was completed using ArcGIS Pro. See [Local Bivariate Relationship](http://gg.gg/19yw9b) for an explanation of the bivariate analysis tool.
