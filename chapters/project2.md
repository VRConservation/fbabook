# Project Design

Coming soon!


<!--  
**Outputs** are the tangible products, goods, and services from implementing specific activities. More than one output may be needed to achieve a single intermediate result or objective. To create outputs, ask what the project needs to produce or provide to achieve short to medium-term results. Write outputs as complete sentences, as if already achieved. Put the targeted primary beneficiary group(s) receiving the outputs as the sentence's subject.

```{admonition} Example
Forest sector businesses increased their knowledge of improved technologies and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

**Activities** describe the functions to be undertaken and managed to deliver the project’s outputs to the targeted beneficiaries and participants. Normally, more than one activity is needed to achieve an individual output. Activities are not included at the project design stage to avoid overcomplicating the project results framework. You will include the full breadth of specific activities when you develop the Project Framework (ProFrame) and Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP).

```{admonition} Example
Organization X provides training for owners and staff of forest sector businesses on improved technology and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

The goal, objective, and intermediate results statements will begin to flesh out a programmatic level of planning that projects can tier from. Review the list of questions below and use an “if-then” test to confirm the logic between each level of the results framework. Every statement should clearly lead to the next higher-level statement. Revise your goal, objective, and intermediate result statements if the logic is unclear. Review your results chains and situation assessments to evaluate whether or not collective your goals and objectives will address the problems and measure long-term outcomes inherent in the results chains:

- Do the objectives describe the central purpose of the project?
- Are the objectives specific to the project context?
- Can the objectives be realistically achieved by the end of the project?
- Do the objectives logically contribute towards the achievement of the goal?
- Does the number of objectives make sense given the project time frame, scope, scale, and budget?
- Do the intermediate results reflect the project strategy and theory of change?
- Do the intermediate results reflect the right change agents and behaviors?
- Is the complement of intermediate results necessary and sufficient to deliver change at the objective level?

You should revisit this list of questions as you progress through the design process.
