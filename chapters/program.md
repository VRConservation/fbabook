## Takeaways
- **Programmatic = Proactive**. A programmatic or portfolio design approach creates a pro-active strategy for your business or nonprofit allowing prioritiztaion for the projects and funding you pursue. Instead of the "tail wagging the dog" where you respond to funding requests and potentially change your organization, you create a framework to build programmatic and financial sustainability to reach your objectives, goals, and mission.
- **Acknowledge Assumptions**. All project implmentation interventions have inherent assumptions. Acknowledge these in your theory of change and periodically test if they are correct, e.g., does the intervention lead to the intended outcomes.
- **Iterate and Scale**. Iterate and learn. Start small, experiment, and scale your successes {cite}`ears`. Scaling cite quote from Salafsky and Margoluis {cite}`scaling`.

## Background
The Forest Business Alliance (FBA) created the templates in this workbook to help grant seekers design project proposals for submission to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection’s (CAL FIRE) FY 2023-2024 Wood Products and Bioenergy Business and Workforce Development Grant [Program](http://gg.gg/1agl2y). These templates and guidance may also be useful for USDA Forest Service Wood Innovation and Community Wood Grant [Programs](http://gg.gg/1agk52) and other related grants.

During the design process, your project team will decide which problems and causes to address, what strengths and opportunities to leverage, where you will work, with whom, and at what scale. Your project team will also specify what it will and will not do by establishing achievable and measurable goals and objectives, selecting sound strategies, developing detailed activity plans, and setting targets.

The contents of this guidance document and the accompanying worksheets are presented chronologically: 

1. Assessment / Problem Analysis
2. Results Framework (RF)
3. Budget
4. Strategy Options / Ranking
5. Theory of Change (TOC)
6. Project Framework (ProFrame) / Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP)

The guidance and workbook's step-by-step organization helps you move deliberately through the design process, but keep in mind that project design is iterative and dynamic. As you add detail when progressing from one step to the next, you may find it necessary to go back and revise the information you input during prior steps.

FBA used numerous publicly available sources to create the project design and monitoring templates and adapted information to create resources suited to the CAL FIRE funding opportunity. The [Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation](http://gg.gg/1agk6k), developed by the Conservation Measures Partnership {cite}`cmp`, and [ProPack I: Project Design Guidance for Project and Program Managers](http://gg.gg/1agk6l), developed by Catholic Relief Services {cite}`propack`, are among the key sources we relied upon to develop this chapter.

## Assessment
Program and project planning typically beging with a participatory assessment with your business, organization, and with board, stakeholders and clients. During the assessment phase, you will specify the basic parameters for your project and improve your understanding of the project’s context. Pages 13 through 24 of the [Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation](http://gg.gg/1agli2) provide an excellent primer on assessment. We recommend you take some time to review it. 

Conducting a thorough situation or problem analysis is central to your assessment work. Your design team should review available evidence to complete your analysis, identifying the direct threats, or core problems, and the indirect threats, also known as drivers and causes.

```{figure} /figures/situation.jpeg
:name: situation
Situation model. 
```

A situation model is a tool that visually portrays the relationships among the various factors in your situation analysis ({numref}`situation`). See the generic situation model from the Open Standards in Figure 1 above. The model should illustrate the main cause-and-effect relationships, and include the most important details, yet be as simple as possible. To the degree that it is feasible and useful, you should identify the actors behind key factors.

Project design teams frequently use assessment findings to construct problem trees ({numref}`tree`). These causal diagrams help you identify and study core problems by identifying their immediate and underlying causes and their negative effects. This, in turn, allows you to identify solutions that will address the problems rather than their symptoms. A problem tree is also a useful tool for understanding cause‑and‑effect relationships, and, as such, it provides a vital bridge to the objectives hierarchy in a results framework in the next step of the project design process.

```{figure} /figures/tree.jpeg
:name: tree

```

During problem analysis, process is as important as the end product. The exercise should be treated as a learning experience. Problem tree analysis is typically done with your design team and possibly other stakeholders at a participatory workshop. Participants write problems, immediate causes, root causes, and effects on sticky notes or note cards. Each card should contain only one item. This allows participants to move the cards around and discuss where they best fit within the problem tree. Experience in facilitating the problem tree method and familiarity with the local context are important considerations when selecting a facilitator. Once you have constructed a problem tree with a logical flow, record it on the Problem Analysis worksheet. 

You may need to go through the problem tree analysis multiple times if you plan to include multiple distinct goals in your proposal to CAL FIRE. There are three trees on the Problem Analysis worksheet. Complete as many as you need to. 

Once you complete the problem tree(s), the workbook will automatically populate portions of the next Problems to Objectives worksheet. 

If the Problem Analysis worksheet cannot accommodate your tree(s), you can use your own graphic or simply take a picture of the tree(s) you have constructed. You should still record the core problems, immediate causes, and root causes from your trees on the Problems to Objectives worksheet. This will make constructing their corresponding goal, objective and intermediate result statements easier. If you create a situation model instead of a problem tree, translate the direct and indirect threats to core problems, immediate and root causes on the Problems to Objectives worksheet.

The problems, immediate and root causes, and effects should be supported by evidence that verifies they are true. The evidence and sources should be noted during the problem analysis and documented on the Problems to Objectives worksheet when the analysis is completed.

Once you have created your problem tree(s) or situation model, review the logic by asking these questions:

- Does each cause-effect link make sense? Is each link plausible? Why or why not?
- How well have the causes gone down to the roots? Are there any unidentified root causes?
- What appears to be the relative contribution of each causal stream to the problem/threat? Do some causes appear more than once? Why is this?

Finally, in addition to helping you design a project that responds to causes instead of their symptoms, the assessment and problem analysis you have done will provide findings and conclusions that help you to write a compelling and context‑specific problem analysis for the proposal narrative.

## Theory of Change
A Theory of Change (TOC) bridges the problem analysis visualized in the problem tree(s) and the proposed responses reflected in the project’s RF and ProFrame {numref}`toc`. The TOC clarifies why you believe the selected project strategies will work in the project context and justifies and checks the logic and feasibility of the project’s change hypothesis. A TOC can be expressed in narrative, diagrammatic, or other forms. 

```{note}
A narrative TOC is a concise, explicit explanation of:

“IF we do X, and Y holds true, THEN we’ll achieve Z because a, b, and c.”
```

With this structure, the TOC clarifies how (if–then) and why (because) the project team expects or assumes that certain actions will produce desired changes for individuals, groups, communities or institutions in the environment where the project will be implemented.

```{figure} /figures/toc.jpeg
:name: toc
Simplified theory of change.
```

The TOC is not simply a narrative description of the RF, because the RF only reflects the elements (the “ifs” and “then” parts) that will be delivered by the project, whereas the TOC also states those actions or contributions critical to the project success but which you expect other actors to deliver. In other words, the TOC reflects both the RF and the project’s critical hypotheses or assumptions. Keep in mind that TOCs can be developed for different levels of the objectives hierarchy. A “high‑level” TOC articulates how successful achievement of the project’s objectives will be contributing to longer‑term, broader, lasting change (project’s goal). You should minimally create a TOC at this level. However, often TOCs are developed to describe the whole causal chain—from activities to outputs, from outputs to intermediate results, from intermediate results to objectives, and from objectives to the overall project goal. 

If you decide to express your TOC visually, you may want to use a results chain diagrammatic tool. This is a good choice if you plan to create a TOC from activities to the goal(s). Below is a Generic Situation Model “Factors” with an associated Results Chain taken from Conservation Measures Partnership’s Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation.

```{figure} /figures/rc.jpeg

```

[Miradi](https://www.miradishare.org/ux/home) is specifically made to help project proponents move through and plan the various stages of a program and projects and is widely adaptible. Project managers with place-based scopes (those with a geographic focus) might find [ArcGIS StoryMaps](http://gg.gg/1ahzng) useful to complement their assessment, TOC, and planning efforts. FBA prepared a storymap about [Spatial Business Planning](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/647313bcdb3e4d6c82e4733eee7ab693) as an example of how this powerful tool can be used and add in geospatial analyses to their planning efforts.

## Problems->Objectives
The Problems to Objectives worksheet should be completed after your Problem Analysis has been finalized ({numref}`treeg`). The purpose of the Problems to Objectives worksheet is two-fold:

1. It documents the links between the problems/causes and their evidence. You will provide citations to documents that provide the evidence that confirms the existence and degree of each problem and cause. This information will be useful for developing your project narrative.

2. It documents the links between the current negative condition and the desired future positive condition. The current negative condition is documented in the problems and causes from the problem analysis. The expected results of the project (solution) are the inverse of the problem/cause and are written as goal, objective, and intermediate result statements, which will be necessary to complete the e-Civis Grant Portal Goals worksheet, as well as other required proposal documents.

```{figure} /figures/treeg.png
:name: treeg
Problem tree. 
```

The core problems, immediate causes, and root causes will be automatically transferred from the Problem Analysis worksheet to Column B (Problem/Cause) of the Problem to Objectives worksheet. Next, you should record the evidence and sources for the problems and causes in column C (Evidence for Problem/Cause). Finally, complete the Goal/Objective/Intermediate Result Statements column by turning the problem tree’s core problems, immediate and root causes into mirrored, positive goal, objective and intermediate result statements. See Figure 3 above. These goal, objective, and intermediate results statements will be transferred automatically to the Results Framework worksheet, where the IF-THEN logic can be tested.

Well-written objective statements follow specific formulas at different levels of the project’s hierarchy. Below, we provide guidance on creating statements for each level. Review CAL FIRE’s required metrics before you develop your goals and objective statements because these metrics are specific and required. Reviewing and understanding them is necessary for creating goals and objectives that align with CAL FIRE’s goals.

**Goals** are the high-level, long-term results that a project seeks to achieve. Factors outside the intervention may contribute to the goals. The goal statements are important in defining the scope of change the project expects to achieve. Write goals in complete sentences, as if already achieved. Put the general population of intended beneficiaries as the subject of the sentence. 

```{admonition} Example
Residents of Northern California's low-income, fire-prone, rural areas experience reduced property loss from forest fires because expanded forest sector businesses make forests more resilient to wildfires.
```

**Objectives** are the primary results that an intervention seeks to achieve. Other grantmakers commonly refer to this project hierarchy level as strategic objectives or outcomes. Objective statements describe the noticeable or significant benefits that are actually achieved and enjoyed by targeted groups by the end of the project. Progress at this level is necessary to achieve the goals. To create objectives, ask where we want to be at the end of the project. What are the most immediate things we are trying to change? What elements must be in place before we can achieve our goals? Write each objective as a complete sentence, as if it has already been achieved. Put the targeted primary beneficiary group(s) whose behavior is expected to change as the sentence's subject.

```{admonition} Example
Forest sector businesses have increased their capacity to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

**Intermediate results** state the expected changes in identifiable behaviors by participants or in identifiable approaches by interventions, systems, policies or institutions as a result of what was gained (outputs) through project actions (activities). Progress at this level is a necessary precondition towards achieving the objectives. Write intermediate results as complete sentences, as if already achieved. Put the targeted primary beneficiary group(s) whose behavior is expected to change as the sentence's subject.

```{admonition} Example
Forest sector businesses consistently use improved technology and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

**Outputs** are the tangible products, goods, and services resulting from implementing specific activities. More than one output may be needed to achieve a single intermediate result or objective. To create outputs, ask what the project needs to produce or provide to achieve short to medium-term results. Write outputs as complete sentences, as if already achieved. Put the targeted primary beneficiary group(s) receiving the outputs as the sentence's subject. 

```{admonition} Example
Forest sector businesses have demonstrably increased their knowledge of improved technologies and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

**Activities** describe the functions to be undertaken and managed to deliver the project’s outputs to the targeted beneficiaries and participants. Normally, more than one activity is needed to achieve an individual output. To avoid overcomplicating the project results framework, activities are not included at that stage of the project design. You will include the full breadth of specific activities when you develop the Project Framework (ProFrame) and Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP).

```{admonition} Example
Organization X provides training for owners and staff of forest sector businesses on improved technology and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

## Results Framework
A results framework (RF) is an easy‑to‑read diagram that gives a snapshot of the project’s objectives hierarchy (means‑to‑end relationship) and describes the change the project aims to bring about, why this change is important, and what needs to happen for this change to occur. Here you will make explicit how you expect the project will lead to intended goals and objectives and generate meaningful impact {numref}`goals`.

```{figure} /figures/goals.jpeg
:name: goals
Relationship between goals, objectives, and results. 
```

The goal, objective, and intermediate results statements will automatically populate the Results Framework worksheet from the Problems to Objectives worksheet. Review the list of questions below and use the “if-then” test to confirm the logic between each level of the RF. Every statement should clearly lead to the next higher-level statement. If the logic is not clear, go back and revise your goal, objective, and intermediate result statements.

- Do the objectives describe the central purpose of the project?
- Are the objectives specific to the project context?
- Can the objectives be realistically achieved by the end of the project?
- Do the objectives logically contribute towards the achievement of the goal?
- Does the number of objectives make sense given the project timeframe, scope, scale, and budget?
- Do the intermediate results reflect the project strategy and TOC?
- Do the intermediate results reflect the right change agents and behaviors?
- Is the complement of intermediate results necessary and sufficient to deliver change at the objective level?

You should revisit this list of questions as you move through the design process because you will not have all of the necessary information to make informed decisions until you have gone through all the steps at least once.

## Budget
Identifying and reviewing CAL FIRE’s requirements and other set project parameters early will help focus project design efforts and keep expectations in line with reality. One key parameter is the amount of money available for direct program implementation. FBA has developed a tool to help you determine approximately how much money you can expect to have to implement field-level activities. A rough estimate of how much you will have to do field work will help you make realistic project scope and scale decisions.

Budget planning flow
1. Create draft goals and metrics for the project
2. Draft a back-of-the-envelope budget by project category or deliverable roughing out the approximate costs (use Chris budget calculator with rules that divide out salaries implementation)
3. Write proposal narrative
4. Create project GANTT chart with deliverables from the budget and narrative

```{tip}  
Create GANTT chart in Excel. Make the deliverable names equal in the chart to your budget deliverable headings in the budget spreadsheet. When you change the budget deliverables the GANTT deliverables will also change
```

### Example

## Strategies
Once you determine what you want to accomplish (your goals and main objectives) and roughly how much money is available for direct field-level work, you must consider the strategies required to achieve the project’s desired impacts. 

Please note that even though you drafted preliminary goal, objective, and intermediate result statements when completing the Problems to Objectives worksheet, you can and should refine those statements as you proceed through the design process. Drafting these statements is iterative, like much of the work you will do when designing your project. As the project design solidifies, ensuring that your goals, objectives, intermediate results, outputs, and activities retain their logical flow is also important.

In most situations, various plausible strategies are usually for addressing problems and achieving the project’s desired impacts. Consider evidence to identify relevant, appropriate, and potentially effective strategy options. Evidence you might consult includes:

- Your own assessment findings about needs, gaps, and opportunities.
- Industry best practices that are accepted as most effective or consistently show superior results.
- Lessons learned and findings from case studies, research, and reports that illustrate a strategy works well in contexts similar to those in which your project will be implemented.

Make a list of plausible strategies, and then work with your project team using a systematic process to weigh the pros and cons of each. Depending on the complexity and scope of your project, you may need to repeat these steps for each goal or objective. Answer the questions below for each strategy option. Use the table on the Strategy Options worksheet to summarize your answers.

1. Who is involved: Who does this project strategy work with, and who would benefit?
2. Evidence of impact: What do technical advice, literature, and standards tell you about this strategy’s likelihood of bringing about the desired change? What made this project strategy successful elsewhere?
3. Advantages: What are the advantages of this project strategy option (e.g., cost, feasibility, value for money, leveraging opportunities, scale versus scope, sustainability, etc.)?
4. Disadvantages: What are the disadvantages of this project strategy option (e.g., cost, feasibility, value for money, leveraging opportunities, scale versus scope, sustainability, etc.)?
5. Assumptions: What assumptions does the project strategy make about the interests and influence of project partners, environmental conditions, and market conditions?
6. Risks: What risks are associated with this project strategy option? How can the project strategy mitigate these risks?
7. Likelihood of impact in this project context: In light of the assessment findings, how likely is it that this project strategy can equally address problems, leverage opportunities, and bring about desired change in this project context?

Eliminate all strategies from the list that are obviously inappropriate, not feasible, or show little potential for impact in the project context. Then, regroup plausible strategies into mutually exclusive project strategy options, by considering whether some identified strategies can be combined into a more integrated project strategy. Consider the minimum package of interventions required to achieve the desired impact.

Once you have consolidated your list of strategy options, work with your project team to identify evaluation criteria to compare and select the best strategies. The Ranking Strategy Options worksheet includes common ranking criteria, yet you may establish your own criteria and adapt this table based on your project’s context and other factors. You may want to reduce the list to the most essential, relevant criteria, add other criteria relevant to the project context, and/or adjust the evaluation scale to better fit your project. Additionally, you may want to weight certain criteria during your ranking if appropriate. For example, some criteria, such as addressing donor requirements and priorities, may be so important that any strategy option with a score below 4 (meets most expectations) for these criteria will automatically be excluded.

Now that you have selected project strategy options use evaluative thinking to confirm they will likely produce the desired outcomes and impact.
**

## Implementation
As you developed your RF and TOC and selected viable project strategies, you clarified how intermediate results led to objectives, which in turn contributed towards the goal, and you highlighted underlying assumptions and established the evidence base for the project strategies. During prior steps in the design process, you also likely defined broad illustrative activities and possibly outputs. Now, you will use the Project Framework (ProFrame) & Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP) worksheet to build upon and flesh out this earlier work. 

Discuss how activities lead to outputs (and, in turn, their related intermediate results). Focus on major, illustrative activities or categories of activities. Do not get distracted by details, but rather, focus on making the “how” clear. As you discuss and refine activities and outputs – and how they lead to achieving related intermediate results – think ahead and consider what is feasible given the project budget, timeline, etc. Developing project activities is an iterative process. As you provide more details in the ProFrame (and eventually the budget), you will have a better idea of costs, allowing you to adjust project targets accordingly.

First, in column B, record the outputs you have identified and the activities necessary to achieve them. Additionally, columns L through AA indicate in which project year and quarter the activities will be implemented. You are, in effect, planning project implementation by creating and scheduling activities that will generate the necessary outputs required to achieve the intermediate results, which will contribute to the project’s objectives and goals.

Second, in Column C, record risks and assumptions. You should have already discussed these as they relate to goals, objectives, and intermediate results when you developed your RF and TOC. Review them now, revise if necessary, and record them on the ProFrame. Identify any risks and assumptions relevant to the output and activity levels. Write assumptions in full sentences as desirable, positive conditions that need to be met if the project is to stay on course towards achieving the next level up on the objectives hierarchy. The assumption must hold true for an activity to lead to an output, an output to lead to an intermediate result, and so forth on the results chain. If you identify any potential critical assumptions, your team should determine whether you:

- Adjust the design to minimize the risk;
- Redesign the program or project because the risk is too high; or
- Maintain the design as is, recognizing that the risk exists but is unlikely to affect the project.

Third, use Column D to identify the relevant CAL FIRE metrics for project goals and objectives. And, in Column E, identify means of verification (measurement methods and data sources) for each metric. In other words, in Column E, you should concisely describe how you will obtain the information needed to calculate and verify the metric. You will need this information to complete the e-Civis Grant Portal Goals worksheet. Though not required, you should consider developing custom metrics for any intermediate results and outputs you have included. 

Fourth, use columns F through J to set annual targets for your selected metrics. Only complete metrics for the length of your grant request. In other words, if you intend to ask for three years’ worth of grant support, set targets for three years. Setting targets helps clarify the services or level of change that the project aims to deliver over time. This helps develop an accurate activities schedule and budget that aligns with donor timeframes and budget ceilings.

FBA created the ProFrame/DIP worksheet to identify CAL FIRE metrics and set associated targets required for the application. This worksheet does not replace a good monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) plan. Design teams, especially those creating complex, multi-year projects, should consider drafting a MEL plan for their own use and which also responds to CAL FIRE’s information needs. Pages 38 through 43 of the Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation provide a good primer to help you create a MEL plan {cite}`cmp`. In developing a MEL plan, you would create specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time‑bound (SMART) indicators for all your goals, objectives, intermediate results, and outputs. The e-Civis Grant Portal Goals worksheet you will use to input project metrics and targets does not require fully articulated indicators. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to develop such indicators, as well as the rest of the MEL plan, to facilitate your monitoring and evaluation work.

## Next
Once you have completed your project design, you should develop a budget and narrative. FBA has created budget templates and guidance to assist you, available on the [FBA](https://www.forestbusinessalliance.org) website. The ProFrame/DIP worksheet will be a foundational document during the budgeting process.

Finally, only after completing the project design and budget should you write your technical narrative (i.e., Scope of Work and other related CAL FIRE documents). This will ensure you have all the necessary information to write an accurate, realistic, and compelling proposal.
