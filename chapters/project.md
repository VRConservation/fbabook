# Project & Proposal Design
How to design projects for proposals and cohesive programs

## Work flow
The project and proposal workflow is iterative like program design and similar to the budget process described in the budget section. In general you will follow these steps to develop a project or proposal

1. **Brief**. Create a 1-2 page brief with the following sections:
    - Executive summary. Three-five sentences max outlining the reason for the project, tasks, outcomes, timeline, and budget (and posssibly how much is needed if some funding is secured).
    - Project goals. Project link to programmatic theory of change and goals then project goals/objectives.
    - Tasks. Or interventions. These could be listed under project objectives (see example).

Don't worry about fleshing out these sections in detail. Like a first draft of any document, get the ideas down, the details can be developed later.

```{tip}
Nest your Goals, objectives and tasks like an outline:

1. Goal 1
  A. Objective 1
    1). Task 1
  B. Objective 2
    1). Task 1
    2). Task 2  
2. Goal 2
  A. Objective 1
```

2. **Budget**. Create a back-of-the envelope budget broken down by objectives and tasks. You can just rough out costs of Task by staff, equipment, materials, etc. It's always useful 



## Budget
We've left the budget for last as it depends on the overall framework of situation assessment, results chains, and goals/objectives. However, we recommend developing a back-of-the-envelope budget early in the proposal writing. Just like the entire design process, budget development is iterative. You will need to adjust budget line items and amounts as other project elements take shape or change.

Identifying and reviewing a proposal's requirements and other set project parameters early will help focus project design efforts and keep expectations in line with reality. One key parameter is the amount of money available for direct program implementation. Starting with a rough estimate of the required fieldwork will help you make realistic project scope and scale decisions.

Let's look at an example. A one million dollar project still seems like a large amount of funding for many organizations. Let's put this into a simple budget calculator ({numref}`budget`). In this simplified example, salaries (35%) include benefits and contracted labor. Implementation (50%) is for all non-salary project costs, such as supplies, equipment, and travel. Indirect (15%) is for an organization's operating costs, e.g., rent, utilities, and fees. This immediately informs the project team that roughly half of the request will be implmented.

```{list-table} Back-of-the-envelope budget calculator.
:header-rows: 1
:name: budget

* - Item
  - Amount
* - Salaries
  - 350,000
* - Implementation
  - 500,000
* - Indirect
  - 150,000
* - **Total**
  - **1,000,000**
```

This calculator will give you rough amounts for each broad category. You could also break it down by your already identified objectives and tasks.

```{warning} **Critical**: include inflationary increases in your budget, especially for salaries and material costs that will increase over the project lifetime (at least 4%/yr). If an application only allows one number per item, calculate costs in your budget spreadsheet over the number of years of the project.

```

### Budget process
An internal budget development process is critical for developing defensible numbers to fund the project over time.

1. Create draft goals and metrics for the project
2. Draft a back-of-the-envelope budget by project category or deliverable, roughing out the approximate costs with rules that divide out salaries implementation
3. Write a proposal narrative
4. Create a project GANTT chart with deliverables from the budget and narrative
5. Return to the budget and update numbers

```{tip} Creating budgets by scratch using a spreadsheet can be tedious, especially when funders ask for detailed and summary budgets or the project tiers from a program budget. If you use Excel, create a table with your budget detail

Then select insert pivot table and select the rows and information you want and, presto, you have a summary budget

## Implementation
As you develop your results framework and theory of change and selected viable project strategies, you clarified how intermediate results led to objectives, contributing to the goal. You highlighted underlying assumptions and established the evidence base for the project strategies. During prior steps in the design process, you also likely defined broad illustrative activities and possibly outputs.

Discuss how activities lead to outputs (and, in turn, their related intermediate results). Focus on major, illustrative activities or categories of activities. Do not get distracted by details, but rather, focus on making the “how” clear. As you discuss and refine activities and outputs – and how they lead to achieving related intermediate results – think ahead and consider what is feasible given the project budget, timeline, etc. Developing project activities is an iterative process. As you provide more details in the ProFrame (and eventually the budget), you will have a better idea of costs, allowing you to adjust project targets accordingly.

If you identify any potential assumptions, your team should determine whether you:

- Adjust the design to minimize the risk;
- Redesign the program or project because the risk is too high; or
- Maintain the design as is, recognizing that the risk is unlikely to affect the project.
