How to design projects for proposals and cohesive programs

## Workflow
The project and proposal workflow is iterative, like program design, similar to the budget process described in the budget section. In general you will follow these steps to develop a project or proposal

1. **Brief**. Create a 1-2 page brief with the following sections:
    - Executive summary. Three to five sentences max outlining the reason for the project, tasks, outcomes, timeline, and budget (and possibly how much is needed if some funding is secured).
    - Project goals. The project links to the programmatic theory of change and goals, followed by project goals/objectives.
    - Tasks. Or interventions. These could be listed under project objectives (see example).

Don't worry about fleshing out these sections in detail. When drafting a document, get the ideas down, and the details can be developed later.

```{tip}
Nest your Goals, objectives, and tasks like an outline:

1. Goal 1 <br>
  A. Objective 1 <br>
    1). Task 1  <br>
  B. Objective 2 <br>
    1). Task 1 <br>
    2). Task 2  <br>
2. Goal 2 <br>
  A. Objective 1
```

2. **BOE Budget**. Create a back-of-the-envelope (BOE) budget broken down by objectives and tasks. You can rough out the costs of tasks by staff, equipment, materials, and other key/generic items. Again, don't worry about details here; just make some rough estimates. Napkins and a pen at a restaurant are good tools of the trade here. Seriously, we've often found our rough budget estimates to be close to the mark, capture your inspiration, and get you rolling on a project.
3. **Narrative**. Draft the proposal narrative or scope of work with a detailed description of tasks and activities by objective, using the brief from step one as a guide. At this point, it is worth adding a GANTT chart as a project timeline to show the project workflow and check to see if you've stacked too many activities at certain times or are thinking about an aggressive project implementation schedule.
4. **Rewrite**. Don't be afraid to write and then rewrite various sections. Give each a rest for a few days, then come back to it after working on other sections.
5. **Checklist**. Create a checklist from the proposal RFP solicitation package to ensure you don't forget anything. The [Forest Business Alliance](https://www.forestbusinessalliance.org/) has a checklist on its templates page that may be useful. 
6. **Submit**. If you're working on projects, send the project to colleagues or post on your socials. If you're submitting a proposal, try to submit it well before the submission due date. If it is an electronic submission, submitting early avoids web and system crashes or the chance that your internet is down. In the now rare case of hard copy submittals, finishing early may allow you to hand deliver the documents, but it will certainly allow you to print everything out and mail it without the worry of sitting in a massive post office line, wondering if you'll get the stamp before the 5 pm deadline.
7. **Check in**. For some funders, sending an email may be worthwhile to ensure they received your application.

## Budget
Identifying and reviewing a proposal's requirements and other set project parameters early will help focus project design efforts and keep expectations in line with reality. One key parameter is the amount of money available for direct program implementation. Starting with a rough estimate of the required fieldwork will help you make realistic project scope and scale decisions.

Let's look at an example. A one-million-dollar project still seems like a large amount of funding for many organizations. Let's put this into a simple budget calculator ({numref}`budget`). In this simplified example, salaries (35%) include benefits and contracted labor. Implementation (50%) is for all non-salary project costs, such as supplies, equipment, and travel. Indirect (15%) is for an organization's operating costs, e.g., rent, utilities, and fees. This immediately informs the project team that roughly half of the request will be implemented.

```{list-table} Back-of-the-envelope budget calculator.
:header-rows: 1
:name: budget

* - Item
  - Amount
* - Salaries
  - 350,000
* - Implementation
  - 500,000
* - Indirect
  - 150,000
* - **Total**
  - **1,000,000**
```

The calculator will give you rough amounts for each broad category. You could also break it down by your already identified objectives and tasks.

```{warning} **Critical**: include inflationary increases in your budget, especially for salaries and material costs that will increase over the project lifetime (at least 4%/yr). If an application only allows one number per item, calculate costs in your budget spreadsheet over the number of years of the project.

```

### Budget process
An internal budget development process is critical for developing defensible numbers to fund the project over time.

1. Create draft goals and metrics for the project.
2. Draft a back-of-the-envelope budget by project category or deliverable, roughing out the approximate costs with rules that divide out salary implementation.
3. Write a proposal narrative.
4. Create a project GANTT chart with deliverables from the budget and narrative.
5. Return to the budget and refine numbers. Test assumptions about amounts.
6. Increase amounts. Once you refine the budget, ask if the amounts are enough, especially for multi-year budgets. You may need to factor in inflation, salary raises, or increases in material purchase amounts that may fluctuate with changing markets.
7. Adjust. Adjust the total to reflect what you think is a reasonable ask to the funder. This may require factoring some estimates down.
8. Indirect. Add in your indirect rate. In some cases, especially for public funds, your indirect may be limited to 10-15%. Federal Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreements (NICRA) allow you to add your organizational indirect if it exceeds the default allowed amounts. It takes time to negotiate this agreement, so do it well before you submit a grant.

```{tip} 
Creating budgets by scratch using a spreadsheet can be tedious, especially when you may need to submit it in different formats or summaries. If you use Excel, create a table with your budget details (Select the rows/columns in the table, then Styles>Format as Table, and choose the table format colors you like). Here's an example:

![sum](https://i.imgur.com/MrfdYme.png)

Then, with your cursor in one of the table cells, Insert>PivotTable>OK. Click in the pivot table report field and, in this case, draft Category and Task to the Rows field, Year to the Columns field, and Total to the Î£ Values field (with some number formatting and dragging Communications and Reporting to the bottom):

![pivot](https://i.imgur.com/SLY8TvS.png)

To build out your budget, add more rows to the detail sheet, repeating activities by year. After adding new rows, always click Data>Refresh All to update the summary table(s).
```

## Finalize
Put together your project design and share it. You might be surprised how sharing it widely will force you to hone it for sharing, but then hone it once you get feedback. For both proposals and projects, copyedit your final version with staff and then copyedit it again. Look at it in different formats and, ideally, let the proposal rest for a few days, then copyedit again. This might seem like a waste of paper, or you no longer have a printer(!), but printing out the key written components and editing with a red pen can also help catch additional mistakes or grammatical errors. Good luck!

The FBA can also review projects and proposals, with our staff writers' years of experience with proposal development and successful funding track records. However, we ask that you send them early on in the process, e.g., months before the due date or during the conceptual phase. Please contact us if you're interested in a review.

## Resources
The project design chapter is a very brief look at how to develop projects and proposals. You'll want to dive deeper to develop your project and proposal craft. Here are few additional resources to get going:

- **[Forest Business Alliance](https://www.forestbusinessalliance.org)**. Templates and upcoming workshops to prepare you for proposals and past workshop recordings on various aspects of program, project, and proposal development. 
- **[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com)**. Paying for a much better grammar checker is worthwhile and may even help improve your writing.
- **[Sierra Nevada Conservancy Grant Resources](https://sierranevada.ca.gov/grants/)**. SNC offers a grants newsletter and regular grant writing workshops. If you're in the Sierra, contact your local Area Representative to find out more. The [North Coast Resource Partnership](https://northcoastresourcepartnership.org/) also offers technical assistance for proposals and project development.
