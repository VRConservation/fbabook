# Scaling
A short guide to scaling forest businesses and organizations from local to landscape

## Takeaways

## Background
Surprisingly little is written on scaling nonprofits. Overwhelmingly, a lot is written on scaling businesses. Few to none of this _oevre_ is connected to forest health, with the majority of articles focused on scaling tech startups and most of these exploring scaling nuts and bolts. 

### Emotions
Molly Graham, from her experience of scaling at Google, Facebook, and Quip takes a different approach, examining the people and emotional side of scaling noting that you should not try avoiding or ignoring the emotions that couple with the scaling tornado, but acknowledging they're normal and any other organization will be going through similar circumstances {cite}`monster`. She goes on to say that emotional acknowledgement, that she likens to making friends with the monster chewing on your leg, is only half the battle, the other half is how you respond {numref}`monster`.

### Up/out/deep
In the conservation arena, {cite}`scaling` adapted a framework created by {cite}`moore` for scaling conservation nonprofits. Based on their literature review there are five scaling approaches:

1. **Scaling out**. This involves replicating the initial pilot with three options of 1. expanding the scope, 2. replicating pilots within a program, and 3. promoting innovation diffusion by capturing and communicating what you've learned and getting other organizations to adopt your strategies.
2. **Scaling up**. A systems level approach is taken in this type of scaling, e.g., policy change, to leverage scale across a greater area, rather than testing and replicating pilots.
3. **Scaling deep**. Almost a behavioral change approach or changing underlying values of the actors in a system. Scaling deep might be building a stewardship ethic among landowners or creating and communicating stories that convey the needed values to key audiences.

Piloting projects has several downsides from risk to cost and ultimately leads to what many conservation projects follow what is called the 'pilot and pray' approach {cite}`pathways`. In other words, "supporting conservation actions based on effectiveness, yet ignoring their scalability risks, promoting approaches that limit total benefit" {cite}`pienkowski`. A bottom line reality is that we may frequently be beyond the pilot stage for forest or biodiversity conservation due to the advanced state of wildfires, climate change, and habitat loss. {cite}`pienkowski` go on to say the inverse can be true, e.g., promoting scalability over effectiveness and that effectiveness can change with scale, possibly requiring different methods to measure outcomes. For example, voluntary carbon markets have failed to deliver benefits due to inadequate methods to measure additionality {cite}`west`.

### Farmer-2-farmer
Compared to agriculture, conservation falls far behind in understanding the factors related to adoption and scale {cite}`pienkowski`. In his seminal book on farmer-to-farmer extension called Two Ears of Corn, Roland Bunch describes a type of scaling that starts small and spreads by diffusion {cite}`ears`. One of the main components of this approach stars with small-scale experimentation. Experimentation at this level is driven by the farmer on small, ~50 m2 plot in a low-risk approach. Small-scale experimentation has several advantages at the programmatic level since it can reach the poorest farmers due to its low-risk, low-cost approach.

As more farmers do more experiments and successful strategies are chosen, diffusion of the program spreads rapidly as farmer adopt cost-effective farming practices. The approach also has the advantage of being self-sustaining and does not need technical assistance from outside 'experts' as farmers learn directly from one another, in other words, the program creates and turns its flywheel {cite}`collins`. Similar to the scaling deep approach mentioned above farmer-to-farmer approaches can be scaled as movements and connected to social movements for food sovereignty {cite}`fertile`.

{cite}`fertile` offers a similar scaling framework to {cite}`scaling`:

1. **Depth**. Groups of farmers are able to innovate on their farms.
2. **Breadth**. Also known as horizontal scaling and achieved when practices are spread across many households and communities.
3. **Verticality**. Comes into play when enabling farming practices across networks and movements and linking community farmers to markets and supportive policies.

Funding is an important factor in scaling not covered in the the agricultural examples above. In the check your scaling assumptions {cite}`scaling` provide an excellent example of developing realistic budgets based on strategic plan goals and costing those out over time. They show that for a hypothetical organization to reach a seemingly realistic, but ambitious goal, of 500,000 tons of CO2e sequestered, the organization will have to carry out 250 projects over a decade. This is when s*%t gets semi-real. They then create a financial model to work out total projects, costs, tons of C sequestered and cost/ton. The up front work clearly demonstrates the value of testing assumptions made to successfully carry out a plan {cite}`scaling`. A similar analysis could be completed simultaneously that focuses on staffing and workforce needed to carry out the plan.

### Business
Scaling businesses is a dual edged sword in that it's a well-worn pathway with many examples of success, yet the pressure to scale takes place from the get go with expectations for profit and system-level success. Factors business owners may want to consider when planning to scale include (will flesh these out)

Markets. Including new markets
Finance. Capital outlay/loans/finance
Quality control
Leadership/ownership
Maintenance
Sustainability? and triple bottom line

## Challenges
Rapid scaling is a huge challenge, particularly for nonprofit organizations that are often not able to scale rapidly due to funding, workforce, and governance issues. Looking at these issues can seem overwhelming, but each individually is not insurmountable. Executing agreements could be fixed immediately, for instance. In fact, it does seem that some agencies have made great strides here in recent years, although others lag behind.

- **Workforce**. Finding qualified employees is a major challenge for the private and public sector. RPFs are in short supply, knowledgeable mill operators are difficult to find and challenging to train. Even putting together qualified thinning or prescribed fire crews led by experienced individuals is very challenging. For nonprofits that offer lower salaries than the private sector, challenges are increased.
- **Chicken and egg finance**. Banks are no longer experienced in-house with the due diligence required to review loans for forest health and infrastructure projects. To compensate, they ask businesses to come back once the business is functioning. This chicken and egg situation, akin to not being able to apply for a job out of college w/o experience, is trying for new businesses or existing businesses trialing new technologies. This challenge may decline over time but certainly does not help accelerating the pace and scale of forest health treatments in the present moment.
- **Funding & scale**. Funders often ask for a scalable projects, but don't provide the necessary funding to do so, or provide enough for startup and not scaling. Also public investment through grants, fantastic for trialing new and innovative programs or equipment, is not being leveraged with private funding.
- **Nonprofits scaling speed**. Nonprofits typically do not scale quickly. It's impossible to scale when you fund many project based on a reimbursable format such as the funding from most state and federal agencies.
- **Agency agreements impede scale**. At the moment, the slow speed of executing agency agreements, some may take upwards of one year follow grant awards, significantly impedes pace and scale of forest health implementation. The cost and speed of environmental compliance is a similar issue putting the brakes on project implementation.
- **NIMBY**. Alpenglow Timber example
- **Project size â‰  need**. Coordination across multiple actors in a region is challenging, but do-able. Look at projects in the CNRA tracking and they look puny compared to the actual task at hand of 1 million acres treated
- **One size doesn't fit all**. And this makes for a conundrum that prevents scaling since every effort to scale requires bespoke changes in policy, funding, workforce, behavioral and institutional change {cite}`churches`. 
- **Effectiveness & scalability**. Total impact = effectiveness + scalability {cite}`pienkowski`. Evidence of scaling effectiveness, readiness, and risk evaluation is often lacking.

## Recommendations
Considerations to incorporate scale when developing your business, project, and programs for forest health:

- **Scale from the outset**. Consider scaling from the start of your program design.
- **Calculate scale costs**. Rough out costs of scaling your work and assess feasibility.
- **Emotional scale**. Be aware of the emotional cost of scale on you as a business owner or nonprofit manager as well as the impact it may have on your staff.
- **Replication & adoption**. Replication and adoption are moving targets and change as you scale.
- **Effectiveness**. Measuring success becomes more complicated with scale, but infinitely more valuable for learning and determining what is working or not.
