# Scaling
A short guide to scaling forest businesses and organizations from local to landscape

## Takeaways

## Background
Surprisingly little is written on scaling nonprofits. Overwhelmingly, a lot is written on scaling businesses. Few to none of this _oevre_ is connected to forest health, with the majority of articles focused on scaling tech startups and most of these exploring scaling nuts and bolts. Molly Graham, from her experience of scaling at Google, Facebook, and Quip takes a different approach, examining the people and emotional side of scaling noting that you should not try avoiding or ignoring the emotions that couple with the scaling tornado, but acknowledging they're normal and any other organization will be going through similar circumstances {cite}`monster`. She goes on to say that emotional acknowledgement, that she likens to making friends with the monster chewing on your leg, is only half the battle, the other half is how you respond {numref}`monster`.

Acknowledging and responding to the monster chewing on your leg is critical for managing scaling.

In the conservation arena, {cite}`scaling` created a framework for scaling conservation nonprofits. Based on their literature review there are five scaling approaches:

1. **Scaling out**. This involves replicating the initial pilot with three options of 1. expanding the scope, 2. replicating pilots within a program, and 3. promoting innovation diffusion by capturing and communicating what you've learned and getting other organizations to adopt your strategies.
2. **Scaling up**. A systems level approach is taken in this type of scaling, e.g., policy change, to leverage scale across a greater area, rather than testing and replicating pilots.
3. **Scaling deep**. Almost a behavioral change approach or changing underlying values of the actors in a system. Scaling deep might be building a stewardship ethic among landowners or creating and communicating stories that convey the needed values to key audiences.

## Challenges
- Gov efforts focused mostly on nonprofits, RCDs and agencies. Deploying capital to businesses and startups is slow and doesn't always focus on what's needed most, e.g., operating capital, or support during the most challenging phases of startup or scaling when needed the most.
- Agreements, contracting and compliance may also slow scaling.
- Public capital is not being leveraged with private.
- Coordination across multiple actors in a region is challenging, but do-able. Look at projects in the CNRA tracking and they look puny compared to the actual task at hand of 1 million acres treated

## Lessons
- Consider scaling from the start of your program design
- Rough out costs of scaling your work and assess feasibility.
