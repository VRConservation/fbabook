# Project Design

**Outputs** are the tangible products, goods, and services from implementing specific activities. More than one output may be needed to achieve a single intermediate result or objective. To create outputs, ask what the project needs to produce or provide to achieve short to medium-term results. Write outputs as complete sentences, as if already achieved. Put the targeted primary beneficiary group(s) receiving the outputs as the sentence's subject.

```{admonition} Example
Forest sector businesses increased their knowledge of improved technologies and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

**Activities** describe the functions to be undertaken and managed to deliver the project’s outputs to the targeted beneficiaries and participants. Normally, more than one activity is needed to achieve an individual output. Activities are not included at the project design stage to avoid overcomplicating the project results framework. You will include the full breadth of specific activities when you develop the Project Framework (ProFrame) and Detailed Implementation Plan (DIP).

```{admonition} Example
Organization X provides training for owners and staff of forest sector businesses on improved technology and practices to clear forested rights-of-way.
```

The goal, objective, and intermediate results statements will begin to flesh out a programmatic level of planning that projects can tier from. Review the list of questions below and use an “if-then” test to confirm the logic between each level of the results framework. Every statement should clearly lead to the next higher-level statement. Revise your goal, objective, and intermediate result statements if the logic is unclear. Review your results chains and situation assessments to evaluate whether or not collective your goals and objectives will address the problems and measure long-term outcomes inherent in the results chains:

- Do the objectives describe the central purpose of the project?
- Are the objectives specific to the project context?
- Can the objectives be realistically achieved by the end of the project?
- Do the objectives logically contribute towards the achievement of the goal?
- Does the number of objectives make sense given the project time frame, scope, scale, and budget?
- Do the intermediate results reflect the project strategy and theory of change?
- Do the intermediate results reflect the right change agents and behaviors?
- Is the complement of intermediate results necessary and sufficient to deliver change at the objective level?

You should revisit this list of questions as you progress through the design process.


## Implementation
As you develop your results framework and theory of change and selected viable project strategies, you clarified how intermediate results led to objectives, contributing to the goal. You highlighted underlying assumptions and established the evidence base for the project strategies. During prior steps in the design process, you also likely defined broad illustrative activities and possibly outputs.

Discuss how activities lead to outputs (and, in turn, their related intermediate results). Focus on major, illustrative activities or categories of activities. Do not get distracted by details, but rather, focus on making the “how” clear. As you discuss and refine activities and outputs – and how they lead to achieving related intermediate results – think ahead and consider what is feasible given the project budget, timeline, etc. Developing project activities is an iterative process. As you provide more details in the ProFrame (and eventually the budget), you will have a better idea of costs, allowing you to adjust project targets accordingly.

If you identify any potential assumptions, your team should determine whether you:

- Adjust the design to minimize the risk;
- Redesign the program or project because the risk is too high; or
- Maintain the design as is, recognizing that the risk is unlikely to affect the project.
