## Abstract
This chapter explores the forest restoration needs within low-income and underserved communities in California, integrating socio-economic and environmental data to identify areas requiring urgent attention.

Our analysis synthesizes poverty and socioeconomic data from datasets at the census tract and county levels. To assess forest restoration needs, we utilized data from CAL FIRE’s Vegetation Treatment Plan to identify land and forest treatment areas to address fire risk and mitigation efforts. By merging these datasets with GIS and data analysis, we shed light on the low-income communities and regions most in need of support for forest health treatments.

Our findings are: Of California’s 17.9 million acres of private land that’s treatable, **14.5 million acres are in high-poverty counties (poverty rates exceed 20%), and 4.7 million acres are in extreme-poverty counties (where poverty rates exceed 40%)**. That’s one-third of identified regions with wildfire treatment needs in extreme poverty locations (and 80% in high-poverty areas). Six counties comprise 53% of treatable land in extreme poverty zones (Tehama, Mendocino, Humboldt, Kern, Siskiyou, Shasta)—they have 2.5 million acres.

This comprehensive approach illuminates the intersection of socio-economic vulnerability and environmental priorities, underscoring the areas where additional funding and resources are essential to meet California’s state objectives for forest management and community resilience.

We hope our findings inform businesses, policymakers, and stakeholders, advocating for prioritizing disadvantaged communities in forest restoration and land treatment efforts to foster equitable environmental stewardship and enhance overall environmental health.

## California Context
California's environment is a mosaic of diverse ecosystems, each contributing uniquely to the state's ecological richness and economic vitality.

### Ecosystems & Climate
The state's geography spans coastal regions, the Sierra Nevada, desert regions, forested areas, chaparral and shrublands, grasslands, wetlands, the central valley, and many more landscapes and water bodies, fostering various climatic conditions and habitats. This diversity is both a strength and a vulnerability, as it creates unique challenges in managing natural resources and mitigating environmental hazards.

These challenges are exacerbated in the face of climate change. Over the past eight years, California has experienced record-high summers, with the average annual temperature increasing by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (since 1895).[^1] Consequently, the state faces severe impacts from sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, loss of water supply, higher risk and frequency of wildfires, agricultural loss, and deleterious impact on public health, ecosystems, economy, and natural resources.[^2]

### Wildfire Crisis
This year alone, California has witnessed 3,500 wildfires burning through 219,247 acres, a staggering 20-fold increase in acreage burned compared to last year.[^3] While wildfires are a natural part of forest management, human activities, land use changes, fire management practices, and climate change have intensified their frequency and severity.[^4] Although human activities cause most wildfires, their likelihood of occurring and intensity has increased dramatically due to global warming changes to aridity, seasonality, and severe weather [^5]. The recent scorching dry summers readily set anything ablaze with little spark. Sadly, this trend is only heading upward with experts “warning that the region has entered an era of ‘megafires’”.[^6]

### Socioeconomic disparities
Frequent and intense wildfires have significant implications, particularly for low-income and underserved communities. Research indicates that these communities experience more frequent wildfires and face greater challenges in fire prevention and response; thus, fire-prevention planning should consider them when designing strategies.[^7] Traditional "high-hazard" zones, often affluent areas with high property damage costs, overshadow the critical "high-risk" zones—low-income communities that suffer repeated fires and subsequent health impacts from persistent air pollution.[^8]

Studies have shown how these fires disproportionately impact the health of low-income communities with higher daily cardiovascular hospitalization in areas that had lower education, lower health insurance coverage, lower tree canopy coverage, and higher density of racially marginalized residents.[^9] The health implications of repeated air pollution and smoke exposure extend to Indigenous people who experience a higher volume of acres burned.[^10]. To summarize, underserved, low-income, and disadvantaged communities are not only the victims of wildfires but also part of the key to reducing wildfires and their impacts. They have fewer resources and less access to capital necessary to adapt to climate and wildfire resiliency; however, that could change based on policies and increased capital. As individuals who are close to the problem, they could be instrumental in implementing fire reduction solutions and mitigating climate impacts by being stewards of lands through restoration efforts.

### Solutions, Programs, and Gaps
A great deal of work (on both the capital and policy side) is being done to address the wildfire challenges across the state. In collaboration with the State of California, the California Natural Resource Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and many other federal, state, local, and non-government entities, the Forest Management Task Force published California’s Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan.[^11] This comprehensive report sheds light on the strategies and key actions that these organizations hope to achieve, such as treating 500,000 Acres of USFS Land annually by 2025 (as part of the Forest Carbon Plan and Shared Stewardship Agreement), increasing sustainable timber harvest, identifying strategic fire management zones, and many more.[^12] 

To meet this goal, private landowners are key. Since 2016, CAL FIRE has increased its forest thinning and prescribed fire activities from 30,000 to 50,000+ acres. [^13] Other state-funded partners have treated 30,000+ acres (in 2020) [^14]. Private landowners manage 250,000-300,000 acres through various mechanisms and treatments. [^15] This is still short of the 500,000 acres of annual treatment; hence, California plans to expand assistance to private landowners, implement forest resiliency projects, and support sustainable harvest.

Some programs currently available to private landowners include:

- California Forest Improvement Program: provides private forest landowners with technical and cost-share financial assistance for forest management.[^16] 
- Forest Stewardship Program: provide forest landowners with funding for best forest management practices. [^17]
- Wildfire Resilience Program: a grant program that improves forests and reduces fire risk (priority projects benefit disadvantaged communities and public or protected lands).[^18]
- CAL FIRE grants: provide funding for initial fuel treatments and follow-up maintenance to landowners that contribute 10% of costs.[^19]
- The CAL FIRE program will directly fund tribal governments to support cultural burning and other traditional forest practices.[^20]
- Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP): provides forest landowners with cost-share funding for management practices.[^21]
- Emergency Forest Program (EFRP): provides private landowners cost-share payments to restore forests damaged by natural disasters.[^22]
- My Sierra Woods: an American Forest Foundation program that provides financial aid to family forest landowners in Northern California.[^23]
-	 A partnership with CAL FIRE, USFS, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Services, the American Forest Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, and UC Cooperative Extension is working to create a comprehensive program that assists small landowners in forest treatment and post-fire recovery. 

Despite significant efforts, California's wildfire resilience strategy faces two major gaps: limited state funding and a lack of a common framework or shared goals.[^24] These gaps are critical since not all regions have equal access to capital and resources necessary for effective wildfire management. Additionally, federal programs often require upfront capital from private landowners, posing challenges for those unable to afford restoration and management costs.

## Research Methods & Approach
The following section outlines the methods and approach to the study.

### Objective
This research investigates the overlap of identified wildfire treatment needs and low-income communities. While it is well-established that wildfires disproportionately affect low-income communities, it is crucial to understand the extent to which California's fire reduction strategies and treatments currently cover private low-income lands. Previous studies have examined the relationship between populations and communities and past wildfires. Still, few have analyzed this issue at the acreage and census tract level concerning opportunities and solutions, i.e., identified treatable lands.[^25] By focusing on the spatial distribution of wildfire treatment areas in low-income regions, this research aims to design more effective local solutions that target the most vulnerable communities. Understanding the acreage of treatment in these areas is essential for developing targeted strategies that mitigate wildfire risks and address the underlying socioeconomic disparities.

### Land Ownership Dataset
We examine California’s land ownership profile through CAL FIRE’s California [Land Ownership dataset](https://data.ca.gov/dataset/california-land-ownership) and the California [Census Tract Dataset](https://koordinates.com/layer/96035-california-us-census-tracts/). These lands were identified as public acres using the CPAD (California Protected Areas Database), BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs), DOD (Department of Defense), and FWS (The Fish and Wildlife Service).[^26] [^27] This dataset excludes the following lands: lands under FWS leases or easement (excludes lands managed by FWS but not owned by FWS); BIA areas that represent mineral rights; CPAD areas that are privately owned (e.g., HOAs).

As with most datasets, there are known gaps and discrepancies. One such gap is missing BOR, ACE, and Navy lands not in the CPAD or DOD MIRTA datasets. Because this dataset is used to identify private lands, this gap may slightly overestimate private land acreage. Additionally, there may be other data discrepancies due to data transformations and processes. Nonetheless, the results are generally sound and within an acceptable range. Checks were available for these data points through online queries.[^28]

In this research paper, we only examine different variables (treatment lands and poverty) on private lands. The Private Lands dataset was created by subtracting public lands from California’s total acres.

### Poverty Dataset
The poverty data used in this research comes from the [CalEnviroScreen4.](https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen/report/calenviroscreen-40), which was created by the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) to “identify communities that are disproportionately burdened by multiple sources of pollution”.[^29]

- **OEHHA’s Poverty Indicator Definition**: This is the percent of the population living below two times the federal poverty level (from a 5-year estimate for 2015-2019).[^30] The primary source for this data is the American Community Survey- US Census Bureau, which uses income thresholds based on family size to determine poverty level. It is important to note that OEHHA used a poverty threshold two times the federal poverty level because California has a higher cost of living than most states. This is to account for the fact that the methodology for determining federal poverty has not changed in the past 40+ years. NOTE: In this research, Poverty Rate = Population % in Poverty.

- **Poverty Population Threshold: High Poverty 20%; Extreme Poverty 40%**. The USDA defines areas of “high poverty” as those with a poverty rate of 20%+ and “extreme poverty” as those with a poverty rate of 40%+.[31] For this research, we examined areas where 40%+ of the population is in poverty since those are areas of high impact and need. 

### Treatable Lands Dataset
The CAL Vegetation Treatment Program Environmental Impact Report and dataset (California Vegetation Treatable Landscape) identifies treatable landscapes that would increase California’s wildfire resilience. This dataset uses the defined SRA (State Responsibility Areas) for which CAL FIREis legally responsible for providing Fire Protection to [^32] and wildland-urban interface areas (WUI) and breaks it into vegetation types as identified by the California Wildlife Habitat Relationship (CWHR) system. Three levels of analysis were done to produce the final dataset, which identified 20-23M acres of treatable lands within SRA’s 30M acres.[^33] Currently, only 250,000 acres are treated annually; however, the goal is to increase the pace and scale of treatment to 500,000 acres annually.[^34]

This dataset includes federal, public, and private lands (private lands adjacent to urban developments and in rural and undeveloped areas [^35]) but excludes the following types of land:
- Vegetation types that have low or negligible wildfire risk (estuarine, wet meadows)[^36] 
- Agricultural lands (since it is outside of SRA)[^37]

The Treatable Lands Dataset includes the following definitions:

**Treatment Definition**: Treatment includes “prescribed burning, mechanical treatment, manual treatments, herbicide application, and prescribed herbivory to reduce hazardous vegetation,” constructing fuel breaks, and ecological restoration.[^38]  

**Treatment Overlap % Definition**: The treatable land dataset overlapped with the private land ownership dataset (at a census tract level) to identify how much private land was treatable. This proportion of treatable private land is defined in this research as Treatment Overlap %. 

### Methodology
QGIS was used for spatial analysis, and all numerical analysis and data transformations were performed using Excel and Python. Almost all datasets had broken geometries and required geometry repairs. Data transformations were also performed to ensure that all datasets used the same coordinate systems and that the data was cleaned before analysis. This process may have resulted in data discrepancies. Multiple and various types of checks were performed throughout the process to ensure the results were within an acceptable range.

## Key Findings
This research has identified several critical insights that underscore the complex relationship between wildfire treatment needs and economic vulnerability in California. It has also provided a way to identify high-impact opportunity areas where financial assistance might have a greater socio-economic and environmental impact.

California has about 104.7 million acres, of which 54 million (52% of the state) are public lands and about 50 million (48% of the state) are private lands. The total acreage of private lands that are treatable for wildfire reduction is 17,966,967 acres (3,620,887 acres on public lands).

The bivariate choropleth graph below only highlights the extreme poverty areas with at least 40%+ overlap with treatment lands. This important intersection of treatment and economic need is represented in purple.

For a higher-level view of which counties have these high-impact opportunity areas, see the county-level map below (where the darker the purple, the greater the treatable private acreage in that extreme poverty region).

Below is a table that shows the top 10 California counties with the largest total treatable private acres in extreme poverty.

The study had the following key findings:
- There are approximately **18 million acres of private land in need of wildfire treatment** across the state.
- 15 million acres, or **86% of all treatable lands, are concentrated in High Poverty Areas** (where the poverty rate exceeds 20%).
- Nearly **5 million acres, about 30% of all treatable lands, are concentrated in Extreme Poverty zones** (where the poverty rate exceeds 40%).
- **Six counties comprise 53% of treatable land in Extreme Poverty Zones** (Tehama, Mendocino, Humboldt, Kern, Siskiyou, Shasta), cumulatively totaling 2.5 million acres.
- **Tehama County has the most treatable land** (329,876 acres) in the extreme poverty category.

## Next Steps
The research confirms that low-income and underserved communities are critical in the fight against wildfires. They comprise most of the opportunity in private lands where treatment has been identified as necessary. These communities, however, are often less equipped to recover and adapt, exacerbating their vulnerability. Such research can guide capital to be allocated more effectively by focusing resources on high-need areas and implementing strategies that address both environmental and socio-economic vulnerabilities:

- **Targeted Investment in High-Risk Areas**: Directing funds toward counties and census tracts with the highest concentration of treatable private lands in high and extreme-poverty areas can maximize the impact of wildfire reduction efforts. By prioritizing these high-risk regions, capital can be used more efficiently to reduce fire hazards and enhance community resilience.
- **Incentivizing Private Landowners**: Developing financial incentives and support programs for private landowners, particularly those in economically disadvantaged areas, can encourage widespread adoption of wildfire mitigation practices. Grants, low-interest loans, and tax incentives could be tailored to support landowners in implementing prescribed burns, mechanical treatments, and other fire reduction strategies.
- **Community-Led Stewardship Programs**: Investing in community-led stewardship programs can empower residents, especially in low-income communities, to take an active role in wildfire prevention and land management. These programs can provide training, resources, and support to foster local expertise and ownership of fire resilience initiatives.
- **Health and Economic Support**: It is crucial to allocate funds to address the health and economic impacts of wildfires on low-income communities. This includes supporting healthcare services, improving air quality, and providing economic assistance to those affected by repeated fires. These measures can help communities recover more quickly and build long-term resilience.
- **Collaborative Public-Private Partnerships**: Encouraging collaboration between government entities, non-profit organizations, and private landowners can lead to more comprehensive and effective wildfire management strategies. Public-private partnerships can leverage diverse resources and expertise to implement large-scale, coordinated efforts addressing environmental and social challenges.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Utilizing detailed data on land ownership, poverty levels, and wildfire risks can enhance the precision of funding allocations. By continuously updating and refining this data, stakeholders can ensure that resources are directed to the areas of greatest need and potential impact.

## Future Research
Future research should delve deeper into several areas to enhance understanding and inform policy and intervention strategies:

- **Granular Data on Private Landowners**: More detailed demographic data on private landowners, particularly distinguishing between industrial and non-industrial landowners, would provide a clearer picture of who controls treatable lands. This, in turn, can aid in structuring financial incentives, policies, and products for specific stakeholders within the larger private landowner group.
- **Spatial Health Impact Studies**: Investigating the long-term health impacts of repeated wildfire exposure on low-income communities can offer insights into necessary public health interventions in conjunction with wildfire reduction efforts.
- **Types of Wildfire Reduction Treatments**: Utilizing more granular information on the different treatment types across geographies can help evaluate the effectiveness of existing wildfire reduction treatments on private lands, especially in high—and extreme-poverty areas. It may guide strategists in identifying best practices and areas needing changes.
- **Economic Resilience Measures**: Studying the economic resilience of low-income communities post-wildfire events to develop targeted support mechanisms to help these communities recover and adapt more effectively. This pairs wonderfully with examining reforestation needs post-wildfire and how low-income communities can participate in recovery and climate resiliency.
- **Policy and Funding Impact**: Analyzing the impact of current policies and funding on implementing wildfire treatment strategies, focusing on increasing resources and access for low-income communities.

## Conclusion
The challenges California's diverse ecosystems face are compounded by the increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires driven by climate change. This research illuminates the critical intersection between wildfire treatment needs and economic vulnerability, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted interventions.

Low-income and underserved communities are disproportionately affected by wildfires, experiencing higher health and economic burdens. However, they also hold potential as key players in mitigating wildfire risks through community-led stewardship and restoration efforts. California can better safeguard its natural landscapes and most vulnerable populations by aligning wildfire treatment strategies with socio-economic resilience measures. Future studies and policy developments should prioritize these high-risk, high-need areas to foster a more equitable and effective approach to wildfire management and climate adaptation.

## Appendices

### Appendix 1: Land Ownership
Restoration efforts are readily implemented on California’s public lands (which range from 47%-52% of the state [^39]); however, given that the remainder of the state is in the hands of private landowners, government entities and organizations must collaborate with these stakeholders to implement wildfire reduction and climate mitigation solutions. Private landowners can be further broken down into industrial and non-industrial private landowners, with 8.7 million acres of timberlands owned by small acreage non-industrial private landowners.[^40] In 2020, the state had around 200,000 non-industrial private forest landowners, of which approximately 60% are 65+ years or older, and only 9% use their forest land for income.[^41] Although granular data on private landowner demographics is not readily available, it would be interesting for future research to utilize this level of detail. Regardless, given their sizable ownership, private landowners (industrial and non-industrial) are important players in the fight against wildfires. The California Land Ownership dataset paints a similar picture, with public lands at 52% and private at 48% (Table 1)

Table 1: California land ownership breakdown.

| Land Ownership | Acres |
| :--- | ---: |
| Public | 54,243,739 |
| Private | 50,520,892 |
| Total | 104,764,631    |

It does not differentiate between industrial and non-industrial private lands. A future study may explore this research topic with this additional granularity, looking only at non-industrial private lands.

### Appendix 2: Poverty on Private Land
In the US, the poverty rate in 2022 was 11.5%, accounting for 37.9 million people living below the federal poverty level threshold.[^42] The federal poverty level is based on household size, location, and income. As a result, it has various income thresholds for various conditions[^43] (e.g., the threshold for a family of four is $25,700).[^44] 

Table 1: The distribution of percent of the total population by Federal Poverty level[^45].

| Federal Poverty Level | <100%      | 100-200%            | 200-399% | >400%
| :------- | ------:  | -------:        | ----: |----: |
| United States | 12.6 | 15.8 | 29.6 | 42 |
| California | 12.1 | 15.3 | 27.5 | 45.1 |

Merging poverty and private land data together, we see that using the 20%+ threshold, about 38,716,802 million acres (or 77%) of private land is in “high poverty.” Using the 40%+ threshold, about 17,098,382 million acres (or 34%) of private land is in “extreme poverty.”

The map visually represents the areas that fall within the high-poverty and extreme-poverty buckets.

### Appendix 3: Treatable Lands
California has invested a lot of resources and effort into planning and designing fire reduction strategies. The CAL Vegetation Treatable Lands dataset, along with the private land mapping, shows us that **the total acreage of private lands that are treatable for wildfire reduction is 17,966,967 acres** (3,620,887 acres on public lands).
