# Resilience Gap

## Abstract
This chapter explores the forest restoration needs within low-income and underserved communities in California, integrating socio-economic and environmental data to identify areas requiring urgent attention.

Our analysis synthesizes poverty and socioeconomic data from datasets at a census-tract and count level. To assess forest restoration needs, we utilized data from CAL FIRE’s Vegetation Treatment Plan to identify areas for land and forest treatment to address fire risk and mitigation efforts. By merging these datasets with GIS analysis and performing data analysis, we shed light on the low-income communities and regions most in need of support for forest health treatments.

Our findings are as follows: Of California’s 17.9 million acres of private land that’s treatable, **14.5 million acres are in high poverty counties (poverty rates exceed 20%) and 4.7 million acres are in extreme poverty counties (where poverty rates exceed 40%)**. That’s one-third of identified regions with wildfire treatment needs that are in extreme poverty locations (and 80% in high poverty areas). Six counties make up 53% of treatable land in extreme poverty zones (Tehama, Mendocino, Humboldt, Kern, Siskiyou, Shasta) - they cumulatively have 2.5 million acres.

This comprehensive approach illuminates the intersection of socio-economic vulnerability and environmental priorities, underscoring the areas where additional funding and resources are essential to meet California’s state objectives for forest management and community resilience.

We hope our findings inform businesses, policymakers, and stakeholders, advocating for prioritizing disadvantaged communities in forest restoration and land treatment efforts to foster equitable environmental stewardship and enhance overall environmental health.

## California Context
California's environment is a mosaic of diverse ecosystems, each contributing uniquely to the state's ecological richness and economic vitality.

### Ecosystems & Climate
The state's geography spans coastal regions, the Sierra Nevada, desert regions, forested areas, chaparral and shrublands, grasslands, wetlands, the central valley, and many more landscapes and water bodies, fostering a variety of climatic conditions and habitats. This diversity is both a strength and a vulnerability, as it creates unique challenges in managing natural resources and mitigating environmental hazards.

These challenges are exacerbated in the face of climate change. Over the past eight years, California has experienced record high summers, with the average annual temperature increasing by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit (since 1895).[^1] Consequently, the state faces severe impacts from sea level rise, coastal flooding and erosion, loss of water supply, higher risk and frequency of wildfires, agricultural loss, and deleterious impact on public health, ecosystems, economy, and natural resources.[^2]

### Wildfire Crisis
This year alone, California has witnessed 3,500 wildfires burning through 219,247 acres, a staggering 20-fold increase in acreage burned compared to last year.[^3] While wildfires are a natural part of forest management, human activities, land use changes, fire management practices, and climate change has intensified their frequency and severity.[^4] Although most wildfires are caused by human activities, their likelihood of occuring and intensity has increased dramatically as a result of global warming changes to aridity, seasonality, and severe weather [^5]. The recent scorching dry summers readily set anything ablaze with little spark. Sadly, this trend is only heading upward with experts “warning that the region has entered an era of ‘megafires’”.[^6]

### Socioeconomic disparities
Frequent and intense wildfires have significant implications, particularly for low-income and underserved communities. Research indicates that these communities experience more frequent wildfires and face greater challenges in fire prevention and response; thus fire-prevention planning should consider them when designing strategies.[^7] Traditional "high-hazard" zones, often affluent areas with high property damage costs, overshadow the critical "high-risk" zones—low-income communities that suffer repeated fires and subsequent health impacts from persistent air pollution.[^8]

Studies have shown how these fires disproportionately impact the health of low-income communities with higher daily cardiovascular hospitalization in areas that had lower education, lower health insurance coverage, lower tree canopy coverage, and higher density of racially marginalized residents.[^9] The health implications of repeated air pollution and smoke exposure extends to Indigenous people who experience a higher volume of acres burned.[^10]. To summarize, underserved, low-income, and disadvantaged communities are not only the victims of wildfires but also part of the key to reducing wildfires and their impacts. Currently, they have fewer resources and less access to capital necessary to adapt for climate and wildfire resiliency; however, that could change based on policies and increased capital. As individuals who are close to the problem, they could be instrumental in implementing fire reduction solutions and mitigating climate impacts by being stewards of lands through restoration efforts.

### Solutions, Programs, and Gaps
A great deal of work (on both the capital and policy side) is being done to address the wildfire challenges across the state. In collaboration with the State of California, California Natural Resource Agency, California Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and many other federal, state, local, and non-government entities, the Forest Management Task Force, published California’s Wildfire and Forest Resilience Action Plan.[^11] This comprehensive report sheds light on the strategies and key actions that these organizations hope to achieve, such as treating 500,000 Acres of USFS Land annually by 2025 (as part of the Forest Carbon Plan and Shared Stewardship Agreement), increasing sustainable timber harvest, identifying strategic fire management zones, and many more.[^12] 

To be able to meet this goal, private landowners are key. From 2016, CAL FIRE has increased its forest thinning and prescribed fire activities from 30,000 acres to 50,000+ acres. [^13] Other state-funded partners have treated 30,000+ acres (in 2020) [^14]. Private landowners manage 250,000-300,000 acres through various mechanisms and treatments. [^15] This is still short of the 500,000 acres of annual treatment; hence, California plans to expand assistance to private landowners, implement forest resiliency projects, and support sustainable harvest.

Some programs currently available to private landowners include:

- California forest Improvement Program: provides private forest landowners with technical and cost-share financial assistance for forest management.[^16] 
- Forest Stewardship Program: provide forest landowners with funding for best forest management practices. [^17]
- Wildfire Resilience Program: grant program that improves forests and reduces fire risk (priority projects are those that benefit disadvantaged communities, benefit public or protected lands).[^18]
- CAL FIRE grants: provide funding for initial fuel treatments and follow-up maintenance to landowners that contribute 10% of costs.[^19]
- CAL FIRE program to provide direct funding to tribal governments to support cultural burning and other traditional forest practices.[^20]
- Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP): provides forest landowners with cost share funding for management practices.[^21]
- Emergency Forest Program (EFRP): provides private landowners cost share payments to restore forests damaged by natural disasters.[^22]
- My Sierra Woods: an American Forest Foundation program that provides financial aid to family forest landowners in Northern California.[^23]
-	 A partnership with CAL FIRE, USFS, USDA Natural Resources Conservation Services, the American Forest Foundation, The Nature Conservancy, and UC Cooperative Extension is working to create a comprehensive program that assists small landowners in forest treatment and post-fire recovery. 

Despite significant efforts, California's wildfire resilience strategy faces two major gaps: limited state funding and a lack of a common framework or shared goals [^24]. These gaps are critical, since not all regions have equal access to capital and resources necessary for effective wildfire management. Additionally, federal programs often require upfront capital from private landowners, posing challenges for those unable to afford restoration and management costs.
