# eCivis
A cheat sheet to assist you in applying online and managing your approved project

## Background
CAL FIRE uses an online system called eCivis to receive applications and administer grants. You will use this system to apply for a CAL FIRE grant and manage and report on that grant if your application is successful. 

The following information covers two stages at which you will use eCivis: 1) the proposal stage, during which you will create a profile and submit all proposal materials; and 2) the post-award stage, during which you will manage your project and use eCivis to submit Activity and Financial Reports. 

It is important to note that this guide is meant to be used in conjunction with the Business & Workforce Development resources provided on CAL FIRE’s website and eCivis-specific materials (in particular, the Grants Portal Application Submittal User Guide and eCivis Grants Portal Applicant Troubleshooting Guide). 

## Proposal Stage
Access the eCivis portal for the Business & Workforce Development Grant Program through the link in the CAL FIRE guidelines for the solicitation you are applying to. Note that this link is updated for each solicitation, so we are not including it here. Guidelines can be found on the grant program-specific webpage on CAL FIRE’s website {numref}`application`.

1. The eCivis link is provided in the Application Process section of the guidelines document (again, guidelines can be found on the Business & Workforce Development website).
2. It is important to create your account through the link in the grant guidelines because this will ensure that you are accessing the correct website and creating an application in the correct solicitation window. Your account will be used for your application and to also administer your grant, should your application be awarded funding.
